no i mean there there there was nothing to it i mean,There was plenty of work involved in this and it was a really big deal.,1
um something that i i think that i've noticed that i i have a friend i think if you're going into like uh law or medicine a very particular very specific field even even engineering you can get you can meet a lot of the requirements at a public um institution,"Law,medicine or engineering students often can't get a job",1
yeah i'm i'm sort of an acting process engineer but not officially but that's pretty much what i do yeah,Engineers usually need to be licensed and well educated.,0
oh yeah all all mine are uh purebreds so i keep them in,mine are all mixed breeds,1
yeah because you look at the statistics now and i'm sure it's in your your newspapers just like it is in ours that every major city now the increase of crime is is escalating i mean there are more look at the look at the people there are being shot now i mean every day there's there's dozens of dozens of people across the nation they just get blown away for no reason you know stray bullets or California they were going out there and they were shooting and they get these guys and they don't do anything with them so i kind of i kind of agree with you i'm kind of you still in the in the uh prison system,"""Every major city is now showing a decrease in crime.""",1
yeah i mean just when uh the they military paid for her education,She originally got into the military in the hopes of securing college funding.,0

and if it's above six hundred you're going to have to do it and i got one thirty one,Over six hundred means nothing at all. ,1
see now in a situation like that the boys are only sixteen years old and they were sexually involved with her and i think like at that particular point she was twenty three you know so she wasn't really that much older than them and being a boy at that age i think that they're very um you know let's face it that's at a point in your life when you you're just starting to realize all the things of life,There was a 7 year gap between those involved in the situation.,2
you sound like this girl that i talked to about books and we got into movies one night,I've never heard anyone talk the way you do.,1
to uh working a steady eight hour job as it were i had been working for a camp and had relatively real long hours sixteen years old and could handle getting up at five and not getting to bed until ten or eleven and,I gave up on working for the camp due to the long working hours.,1
yeah well the jury that originally sentenced him sentenced him to death,The original verdict of the jury was the death penalty.,2
and uh you know it's like they they consider that but it would be the same way here you know it's like if if you had to do it you know you have a big sign i'm sorry i don't get paid you know,"I am paid well, even if it's here and the same.",1
yeah well that's the other thing you know they talk about women leaving the home and going out to work well still taking care of the children is a very important job and and someone's got to do it and be able to do it right and,It is not acceptable for anybody to refuse work in order to take care of children.,1
i think that yeah i think and i i think that's real important,"""I truly believe that that's really important.""",2
now that's an interesting point yeah i mean once the expectations are,That is one of the most interesting things about it.,0
because i i mean i don't know it's just something i think something we need,I think it is completely unnecessary.,1
really oh i thought it was great yeah,I want to do that again,0
defiantly if you live in an apartment right,Defiantly if you live in a house right,1
huh-uh i don't even want to go anywhere yeah that's about it,I prefer not to travel.,2
it depends a lot of uh a lot of things were thought that uh as you know the farmers thought okay we got chemicals we're putting chemicals on the field well the ground will naturally filter out the,The farming chemicals are filtered by the ground.,2
probably so yeah you can get a head start on it,You can't get a head start on it.,1
and so i have really enjoyed that but but there are i do have friends that watch programs like they want to see a particular program and they are either home watching it or definitely recording it they have some programs that they won't miss,Do you have any programs you watch with your friends?,0

exactly and when i'm sitting here on the sofa cross-stitching and all of a sudden somebody a man's got their hand on my door knob it's like uh like oh no and so i don't i don't like that and i guess the only way to prevent it would be just to pass a city ordinance to prevent that or,I don't ever sit on my sofa and do cross-stitch. ,1
more of a football powerhouse up there i guess,He's terrible at football there.,1
yeah you can also do the same thing using um if you have ground beef just stir fry the ground beef drain off the oil use the same hoi sin sauce and um some of the frozen mixed vegetables,Fry the beef steak and eat it plain with salt and pepper.,1
you know our church each year has a one of their major fund raisers is you know a garage sale and there's a ton of clothes always you know left over and i take those down to the uh,Our church also has bake sales each year. ,0

you know some of the really the really emotional ones have you followed the Dallas elections on zoning,I hope you haven't been paying any attention to the Dallas elections.,1
yeah because i was saying to him i said i'm not that heavy i'm not heavy you know maybe ten to fifteen pounds like any other human being,i told him i don't weigh that much,2

yeah right uh-huh that's right yeah you you have to work on you really do,Yeah you really have to work on keeping bugs out.,0

exactly and when i'm sitting here on the sofa cross-stitching and all of a sudden somebody a man's got their hand on my door knob it's like uh like oh no and so i don't i don't like that and i guess the only way to prevent it would be just to pass a city ordinance to prevent that or,A man tried to enter the house so that he could rob it. ,0
that was good and Poland yeah and i've done some of those yeah i like i like things that are those are a few of the ones i can take of his i like it when they actually are giving you information in a novel format i guess would be the,I dislike it when they give you information in a novel.,1

um-hum yeah we're still pretty much you know in winter as far as that goes here,It has been winter here for years.,0
i wish it was as good over here as it is over there but if you're the,I am glad it is better here than over there.,1
yeah it's just a matter of education i think,I think how successful someone is just depends on education.,0
if it had rained any more in the last two weeks instead of planting Saint Augustine grass in the front yard i think i would have plowed everything under and had a rice field,It has rained enough to flood everything here and make rice pattys.,2
i think that yeah i think and i i think that's real important,"""I truly believe that that's really important for us to know.""",0
oh does it sure,"oh, does it do that? of course",2
okay okay that's it that GTE had purchased Tigon and yeah that's what we have,Tigon is definitely part of GTE now. ,2
yeah yeah if they do come up with a positive regardless of what uh what it was they detected uh we're required to go attend a uh a counseling session,Even if they say its more positive than what it seems we will have to go to a counseling session. ,2
uh and i think even Electric Light Orchestra had some some real um influences by classical music and i'm still still my favorite in fact most of my CDs that i got are classical music,"I have some CDs of barney songs, but those aren't most of my CDs. ",1
for me now the address is the same you know my my office address,I am able to receive mail at my workplace.,0
so i don't completely agree with that either,I have different reasons for doubting each.,0
yes i've had a German Shepherd that did that one time,I have never had a pet dog in my entire life.,1
oh really yeah so he he's uh he's probably going to be going to jail and and the problem with him is he's on a guaranteed salary like for three years so whether he plays or not they've got to pay him ten million dollars so if they,"He will probably lose form in jail and be excluded from the first team for the rest of the year, so he's essentially getting paid for doing nothing.",0
yeah i can usually i can put in oh probably mid March i can put anything in the ground you know beets and onions and stuff like that,I usually wait until June before I put anything in the ground.,1
yeah that's that's a big step yeah,"Yes, you have to be committed to make that big step.",0
and the nurses aren't no see you have to pay that,You don't have to pay for that.,1
right oh they've really done uh good job of keeping everybody informed of what's going on sometimes i've wondered if it wasn't almost more than we needed to know,I don't think I have shared enough information with everyone. ,1
and the NIT semifinals are on tonight,The NIT semifinals take place in New York City tonight.,0
no that's true and and and Lord knows with that legislature up there they probably did all kinds of things while he wasn't looking,The Legislature always acts responsibly.,1
yeah um gosh i think it was only like three and a half pounds and for me that's big that's why i'm saying i love to go fishing because i've never caught anything really really big um so because it's always been you know in the on a lake and uh i know they have bigger fish than that but you know three and a half pounds and that was huge for me,It was almost fifty pounds.,1
any bad stuff so uh i think TI we spend of of of all the major semiconductor firms we probably put safety and environmental on the utmost foremost uh uh first thing we always look at and we probably put more money into the systems and engineering behind the systems than any other firm i know of we eat and sleep the stuff everything we do over here and uh,"Compared to other firms, we spend much more on systems and engineering behind the systems",2
when there was the ball that was sort of hit to Buckner to Buckner,The ball was hit to Buckner and he caught it.,0
but i think that's probably a good idea,That's potentially a good idea for the company.,0
in one sense um i'm i'm an older person in my fifties so i feel that we've lost some things in the sense that women have to work today,I don't think my age has anything to do with how I feel.,1
yes i've had a German Shepherd that did that one time,I had a German Shepherd that shed half of its fur once.,0
yeah maybe the maybe they'll bring their good schools with them  you know if the industry comes,"Maybe if the industry comes, they will build good schools here.",2
yeah they're still laying off like over in Fort Worth and a lot of other companies too just here and there,There has been a nationwide trend of people losing their jobs.,0
that's uh only way to do it,There are so many other ways to do it.,1
you know and then how long are they supposed to take it,You know how long they're supposed to take it,2
more than anything else in this day and age that's got to be a big factor in your decision's just the the cost of how much you're gonna pay,In your decisions age is a big factor,2
right well the preseason really doesn't mean anything either,"Right,the preseason is not really important either.",2
yeah and i'll do this uh sometimes i'll put my after I pour that into my back into my saucepan i'll put the eggs in the same dish and beat them up and then pour the cornstarch and the milk mixture in the egg so,I like to add eggs in the same dish because they are healthy.,0
and uh i'm originally from Virginia and uh and my memories of summer have always been that stifling humidity,I've never stepped foot in Virginia and I have no idea what summers are like there.,1
uh uh yeah that well um the older you get the more convenience you try to bring with you i guess so i'm up to dragging the trailer around which is my next step is going to be probably Winnebago i hope if i only can afford one but that,"The older you get, the more you want conveniences.",2
yeah what do you do,What do you do with the teeth?,0
um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah yeah it is i don't know i think it's a very interesting um discussion you know and and there's certainly uh lots of pros and cons around it,This discussion is intriguing and great points have been made.,2
trying to keep grass alive during a summer on a piece of ground that big was expensive,"The watering and fertilizer, can cost a lot to keep grass alive in the summer months.",0
um-hum they keep you entertained they sure do we have a uh my wife's uh mother is uh oh about  seventy seven i guess she really gets a thrill when we go over to see her and bring the dog i think she's more happy to see the dog than she is us,We don't have a dog. ,1
well this is real interesting that you're as far away as you are because i really thought this was uh uh we're,i'm surprised by how far away you are,2
kind of kind of nothing i won't have anything to do with,I think it is an awful waste of time and space.,0
and have been back and every now and then some news filters in that they went to see some of the old things and of course the savings and loan program um that was that you know that that just continued to grow in fact after my group i mean we were just a very small specialized group too to get that going and spread and then of course Peace Corps bowed out of that because that's uh uh something that nationalized very quickly and the same with the coops,I am glad that I get daily news updates about the Peace Corps.,0
okay what types of music do you like to listen to,Do you like classical music?,0
now that's an interesting point yeah i mean once the expectations are,I did not find anything interesting at all.,1
i don't know um-hum,I have no idea about their opening time.,0
do you think most states have that or,Do you think most states have that high murder rates?,0
uh the one we thought would be the most timid uh turned out to be the one that stuck with it and was the first to learn,The one that was first to learn was the one we anticipated to be timid. ,2
i don't know if you have a place there called uh or you probably have something similar we call it Service Merchandise,It is called Service Merchandise here.,2
you know it's it's not easy to do but,You know it's very easy.,1
uh right now we're actually having uh it's getting nice i mean it was in the high fifties today but three and a half weeks ago we had an ice storm,The weather has been getting warmer because the winter has ended.,0
no uh i have a friend who works for TI and uh i work for a a tire service here in i'm from Dallas,I live in Dallas and work for a tire center and my friend works for TI.,2
um we tried that but we really weren't happy with it so he does that all himself now,"Sometimes we help him out, and other times we do it all ourselves. ",1
i guess it's just you know and when i think about that lady this this particular lady who wrote me a check for twelve dollars and it bounced and i sent it through you know sent it through the check through the bank once and she incurred at least a fifteen dollar fee,She didn't realize when she wrote the check that she didn't have enough money in it.,0
uh plastic is just too easy i mean that's the that's the whole problem with it um have,I am addicted to shopping online with my plastic credit card.,0
but but it is peaceful i mean it is relaxing to do once you find the time to do it,"If you have time, it is relaxing.",2
to see this kind of thing and you know if you can do any any little bit it helps so,"To see this kind of thing is bad, don't contribute to it at all if you can.",1
yep because it's when it's self propelled it's heavy yeah,it's heavy when it's self propelled,2
and see if Kansas if Kansas yeah but then you know it could be what if they're not hitting that night or they're low or anything and see i i feel like the college you know it's kids it's still kids,What if they are having a bad night?,0
no it didn't,Yes it did.,1
uh high humidity,Air with increased water content.,2
i i have some feelings about it in the sense that i feel if a person is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and it's a really heinous crime i feel like the Bible says an eye for an eye,I have strong views on it when I think the crime merits the punishment.,2
and uh we went through a time period that we had three Danes,We never had Danes for a certain amount of time.,1
yeah that's up here in New England that's we call that backpacking which is the same thing which is you're you've got everything on your back you know an aluminum camp frame uh,"In the Northeastern United Stated, they hike with all of their supplies on their back.",2
oh really yeah i've i've never seen either one of them,I have no idea what they look like.,0
well what is it,Is it popular?,0
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah well that's really neat,That's awful.,1
it's actually there well Iraq has had uh designs on that place since nineteen twenty two so you know it wasn't like something that just suddenly popped up,Iraq has always wanted to control that area since 1922.,2
so i how do you feel that it should be applied,I do not care about your feeling just apply it whichever way to finish it already.,1
that's neat just supervised more or less than anything and security i guess for them,They just supervise people.,2
well yeah that really is scary,That is frightening.,2
you know and then how long are they supposed to take it,You don't know the length of time they're supposed to take the medication.,1
you know like CODA comes out of your out of your pay and the credit union comes out of your pay so we don't have to do anything there and the rest of it as far as my salary goes i just have it automatically deposited in into our bank,I set things up so that my salary automatically deposits into our bank.,2
and the professors who go there and you're not going to see the professors you know you're going to see some TA you know uh,You don't really see the TAs.,1
see too much crime on TV and they think it's way to go i don't know what do you think,TV has a lot of crime shown on it.,2
or just get out and walk uh or even jog a little although i don't do that regularly but Washington's a great place to do that,"""Washington's and Abraham's are great places for a walk or a jog.""",0
so uh listen i'll call Triple A uh auto club any time,I can only call Triple A during daytime.,1
made it yeah made it all the way through four years of college playing ball but,I played ball in college.,2
if it had rained any more in the last two weeks instead of planting Saint Augustine grass in the front yard i think i would have plowed everything under and had a rice field,It's beed super dry.,1
well this is real interesting that you're as far away as you are because i really thought this was uh uh we're,"you're so nearby, it's surprising.",1
and when they get out they should have uh i don't know you know some reasonable amount of money,They should have ample financial capacity upon release.,2
and uh well if you if you got got him a power mower it'd probably take him a lot less time to do it but i enjoy doing it i feel good doing it uh i i feel a lot better doing it with a power mower with that with a  with a pull tractor on it so i don't have to push so hard,He would mow your entire yard in eight minutes if he was using a power mower.,0
so you know well a lot of the stuff you hear coming from South Africa now and from West Africa that's considered world music because it's not particularly using certain types of folk styles,You would really like to hear the music from Africa in person.,0
yeah yeah i i went i went off to school wanting to either be a high school algebra teacher or high school French teacher because my two favorite people in the in high school were my algebra teacher and French teacher and uh and i was going to do that until the end of our sophomore year when we wanted uh we came time to sign up for majors and i had taken chemistry for the first time that year and surprised myself i did well in it,I was going to major in algebra or french but I ended falling in love with chemistry. ,0
yes it is kind it is family and it's fun it's a fun thing and kids enjoy that and,"It is for the whole family, and the kids hate it.",1
yeah that's a nice place,It's a location I enjoy being at. ,2
i don't know no i don't,I have no knowledge of that.,2
well uh what do you think about taxes do you think we're paying too much,We pay just the right amount of taxes.,1
wow who can afford that  my God i can't afford to miss a day let alone six,"It's amazing that some people can afford to miss days from work, whereas I can't even afford to miss one.",0
i cried when the horse got killed and when the wolf got killed,I went through the entire thing without crying.,1
uh-huh yeah yeah they're good,Everyone thinks they're bad.,1
yeah exactly right it really is because they're gonna get them one way or another they will always have a way look at drugs they always have a way to get that so,They can get drugs easily because they know many drug dealers and where to find them.,0
you know we keep a couple hundred dollars um if that much charged on those which isn't too bad it's just your normal,We have no money on there at all,1
it can't last seven years but it can last five IBM says let's throw it away Leading Edge will say we'll buy it from you,It will definitely last for at least seven years.,1
it was really easy i mean just just did a thumb print you know,"I did a thumb print, that was very easy., you know?",2
well i hear my kids are needing me again so i'll go see what they need  and we'll maybe talk to you again,My kids are independent and do not need me at all.,1
have that well and it doesn't seem like very many people uh are really i mean there's a lot of people that are on death row but there's not very many people that actually um do get killed,Most people on death row end up living out their lives awaiting execution.,2
Detroit Pistons they're not as good as they were last year,Detroit Pistons played better last year,2
i think Buffalo is an up an coming team they're going to they're showing some real promise for the next uh few years,I think Buffalo sucks.,1
some of the professors i think imitate Big Bird,None of the professors attempt to be like Big Bird in my view.,1
because we don't always read the newspaper sometimes it just sits around for a while and then we just chuck it,Sometimes we throw the week old newspapers away without reading them.,2
in Asia yeah i spent,"In Asia, yeah, I spent 3 years",0
well the difficulty is is if you look in the Old Testament and and the numbers of places that uh the Lord went out and just simply struck down and that was part of the problem when they went into the Promised Land that they that they uh they didn't destroy everybody and that that's,The Lord struck down all the places he went to. ,0
and uh my daughter gets irate when i when i do that because you know she's a teenager,My daughter's a teenager and so she gets mad whenever I do that.,2
someone else noticed it and i said well i guess that's true and it was somewhat melodio us in other words it wasn't just you know it was really funny,It was really funny because they fell over when they were trying to walk. ,0
and the nurses aren't no see you have to pay that,You have to pay for that if social security won't cover it.,0
you know it's it's not easy to do but,It's worth it in the end.,0
because the cold weather was just simply trapped along the ground and couldn't get away,The weather stayed for much too long.,0
then there's that uh let's see i like the Lakers Milwaukee Atlanta Hawks i like them too,I like the Chicago Bulls and the Warriors.,1
oh really i was um i was TDY at Bent Waters,I enjoyed my temporary duty at Bent Waters. ,0
well the first thing for me is i wonder i see a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is um if privacy is something that disturbs your private state i mean an invasion of privacy is something that disturbs your private state that's one thing and if privacy is something that comes into your private state and extracts information from it in other words finds something out about you that's another and the first kind of invasion of the first type of privacy seems invaded to me in very much everyday in this country but in the second type at least overtly uh where someone comes in and uh finds out information about you that should be private uh does not seem uh um obviously everyday,"Privacy is very simple, I can explain it to you in a few words, without long and hard to understand sentences.",1
and uh uh so i've i've just been real pleased and my step father happens to work at a Ford dealership and that makes things a little easier come car time but,My step father just got fired from the Ford dealership.,1
um yeah that sounds kind of neat uh is location at all important to you like you know how far it is from your house or whatever,"If something is far from your house does it matter to you, is location important to you?",2
i like the Moody Blues,I do not like the music of the Moody Blues.,1
and they're illegal so i don't think it would do us any good to outlaw them all together,Outlawing guns like that probably wouldn't do any good.,2
that would be good what'd you say,Write down what you would say.,0
we wouldn't be expected to cast a ballet on the subject,There is no expectation for us to vote on the matter.,2
the wagon man got killed when they attacked him,They attacked and killed the wagon man.,2
i like the Moody Blues,I am very fond of the Moody Blues,2
they don't call them immigrants anymore that was back during my granddaddy's day,Now they call them tourists.,0
well what station plays uh that type of music,Which radio station plays that kind of music?,2
well uh what do you think about taxes do you think we're paying too much,Our taxes seem too high. ,0
oh that's not really important the the other stuff is just you know window dressing because we we've never ordered anything fact the the van that we've got we bought uh from an estate it was an estate trade uh it was almost brand new the the gentlemen who owned it had died,We ordered our van and bought it from a used car dealer.,1
it doesn't have to do i mean the thing is is that you know it's like you might be standing somewhere right and like let's say you're you you go you know you're driving out and you're driving back home and it's late at night and you stop by one of these you know twenty four hour you know gas stations joints,Some drivers stop by 24 hour stations at night.,2
and uh it that takes so much time away from your kids,That it depletes your availability from your children.,2
yeah i think i'll probably just have to go with one of those splint braces or something,I most likely need to use a splint brace. ,2
so do you have do you have the long i guess not not if there's see i was raised in New York but i guess up there you all don't have too long of a growing season do you,I have no knowledge of how growing seasons vary across the country.,0
and uh oh i guess an hour into my somewhat sleep a guy woke me up and uh said you'd better get out of the the tent they're they're liable to come down several of the others had already come down blown down they hadn't blown away but they had flattened,No one warned me about the tents being flattened.,1
well it's a pleasure talking with you,It's lovely speaking with you. ,2
uh my uh roommate took a voice over course,There was no voice over course available to take. ,1
i have been and uh some of the boy scouts have been up in there they have got some great hiking trails and camping areas up in there,Boy scouts don't ever go camping or hiking. ,1
they'll they'll say yeah why didn't you buy why didn't you try something more mainline,They will scoff at you for doing something so mainline.,1
yeah well the uh NC double A tournament's going on right now and uh i haven't watched it this year because Louisville's out of it this year,I haven't watched the NCAA tournament this year.,2
yeah well at least as they told us uh two shifts,"A minimum of two shifts, they mentioned to us.",2
and the same is true of the drug hangover you know if you,It's just like a drug hangover.,0
it it i think that is the biggest problem when you really not you don't don't really need the stuff but the nicer looking clothes are the more expensive nicely tailored clothes,It costs more for nicely tailored clothes that you don't need.,2
now you know the ball'll go straight and i go  i never broke a club or anything but you know i'd get upset about it sometimes and now i guess you know being in my forties i just kind of mellowed out a little bit i don't get upset any more so,I still get upset when I don't perform well.,1
much with whatever it's with the Black the Black problem or whatever that may be now,There is a Black issue that could be called something else now.,2
yeah uh-huh but we look at it sort of as an investment in the future too,We should think less about our future and more about what we're investing in today.,1
where they they brew their own beer there,The beer comes from a factory that they purchase it from. ,1
and they're illegal so i don't think it would do us any good to outlaw them all together,"Since they're illegal, it wouldn't do us to to outlaw them all together.",2
you know your children are going you know you've got five children in school instead of somebody that only has one or none and so you they're paying more income tax to pay for your children to go to school it just you know doesn't make sense,People with more children should get lower tax rates than people with less children.,0
i cried when the horse got killed and when the wolf got killed,I cried at least once.,2
oh well yeah that's all i have to say thank you,Good riddance is all I have to say.,1

yeah that's up here in New England that's we call that backpacking which is the same thing which is you're you've got everything on your back you know an aluminum camp frame uh,When you go backpacking it's important to bring a rough terrain wagon to carry your gear.,1
we're thinking about putting one of those in,We are considering taking one those out.,1
we wouldn't be expected to cast a ballet on the subject,We shouldn't be expected to vote on this matter because we do not have sufficient information.,0
or yeah exactly and that's what i say you'll you'll be you'll be so much better off for it as you get older because you know a lot of kids resent things that parents tell them and and stuff but it's because you've been there,Children want more freedom than parents' ideas provide. ,0
yeah well the jury that originally sentenced him sentenced him to death,The sentence later got revised under review of a judge.,0
they really do i i sometimes think that that should be limited more,"No, I do not think they need any additional limits.",1
yeah because those things i think would just snap you know,Because they would break under that much force.,0
and i'm pretty happy with it so far,I don't like it. ,1
i know that i didn't much uh-huh oh,I might have done a bunch.,1
so it's sociology,so it's biology,1
and they have a bar also which is always crowded as can be  but it's it's an specially fine restaurant and when you consider they take no plastic or checks,"They have a bar, which is always empty.",1
uh the one we thought would be the most timid uh turned out to be the one that stuck with it and was the first to learn,The one we thought was timid ended up being the last one to learn.,1
so you know it's something we we have tried to help but yeah,"We didn't make too much of a difference, but we still played our part.",0
that's cool kind of like Pink Floyd or something uh yeah basketball's cool but football kind of after a while,"That's neat, sort of like Pink Floyd, or something similar.",2
and if it's above six hundred you're going to have to do it and i got one thirty one,If it is under two hundred you don't have to do anything at all. ,0

um-hum um-hum yeah well uh i can see you know it's it's it's it's kind of funny because we it seems like we loan money you know we money with strings attached and if the government changes and the country that we loan the money to um i can see why the might have a different attitude towards paying it back it's a lot us that  you know we don't really loan money to to countries we loan money to governments and it's the,We loan a lot of money with strings attached.,2
and the like a guy does it and he has his own pigs,He doesn't have any pigs so he borrows them.,1
hm oh is oh that's great uh-huh do you get the full benefits,That's wonderful. ,2
taken up by the oh okay oh so you know well that's i had wondered sometimes i knew that there was a lot of a lot of effort and a lot of work went into a lot of that and i just wondered if if it lasted and if it took you know like yeah,A great deal of effort and work went into that.  ,2
and you fry them with garlic and a little bit of couple dashes of hot pepper,To cook them you use garlic and a little bit of hot pepper.,2
yeah um gosh i think it was only like three and a half pounds and for me that's big that's why i'm saying i love to go fishing because i've never caught anything really really big um so because it's always been you know in the on a lake and uh i know they have bigger fish than that but you know three and a half pounds and that was huge for me,It was just a few pounds.,2
and my and my part-time work you know it's not our the restaurant our favorite restaurant in the town of Salisbury where actually we live you know where my where i'll return to my job or whatever we can normally eat out for um under fourteen dollars,My first part time job was in a restaurant in Salisbury where you could eat out for under $14.,0

i think that the people that are um have um a lower income which you automatically equate with lower education,I think because you have lower income you are less educated.,0
although the uh it's uh it we almost one day we painted the house to uh we painted we painted the whole inside and it had all this dark trim we thought uh you know we did the one wall but the other trim i'm trying to think i think i think we left most of it because it gets to be uh they don't do that in the newer houses now we don't the uh mold everything is white in a new house everything is white,It took over a day to paint the house,0
life track,The long and winding life track.,0
i also use my PC to emulate a mainframe terminal for our IBM mainframe and also to emulate a deck terminal for our deck machine,My PC is never used to emulate anything.,1
and going to school is also always very prohibitive now unless your parents are wealthy,School is expensive without wealthy parents.,2
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah well that's really neat,"That's amazing, I've never seen anything like it.",0
okay movies i've i haven't seen too many lately i have kids and we went and saw The Rescuers Down Under over the the break do do you have kids you take to movies or,I've never seen a movie.,1

yeah well are you you with TI,Yes well are you affiliated with TI?,2
true yeah i know it isn't that ridiculous we have cable which helps a lot,"It isn't that absurd; we have cable, which is great.",2
and so i have really enjoyed that but but there are i do have friends that watch programs like they want to see a particular program and they are either home watching it or definitely recording it they have some programs that they won't miss,"Your friends don't watch TV, do they?",1
yeah plus uh you know look at the you know the besides the pollution the the aspect of invasion of privacy there's a big pollution aspect too i find i throw out a lot of those flyers and i have no interest in,I have even considered getting a dog to prevent people from putting flyers on my door.,0
uh-huh oh yeah all the people for right uh life or something,all the people for the right life exercise on a regular basis,0
little too much maybe,"Possibly a bit excessive, but let's ask my mom what she thinks. ",0
i can believe i can believe that,It's hard to make sense of the facts otherwise.,0
yeah that's up here in New England that's we call that backpacking which is the same thing which is you're you've got everything on your back you know an aluminum camp frame uh,Everyone in New England goes backpacking on the weekends.,0
yeah yeah you probably get this probably pretty sticky after you get done then you've got to drain the water out of the watermelon because you know when you scrape it it makes the water,You need to drain the water our of the watermelon.,2
yeah they uh they the voters voted one way and it and then uh some federal judge said no that was unconstitutional and they have had two or three votes and the city council is divided over what the district should be because they divide it one way and the minorities say we're losing representation  representation and uh it it's just a big battle,the federal judge overruled the vote of the people on the ground that it was unconstitutional,2
yeah and every once in a while they'll have dressing but uh whoever makes it uh goes crazy with the sage,They always have dressing but they never use enough sage.,1
how long has he been in his present position,Has he held his position long?,2
and when they get out they should have uh i don't know you know some reasonable amount of money,We should give them money for when they get out.,0
oh hum well uh i haven't for some reason have never really gotten enthused about football in the summer from from the the World League,I don't get enthused about other summer sports.,0
paid back down it uh,The balance was reduced through payment.,2
i think the rate of processing is just about uh reached the rate of housing anyway so keep the keep the normal as it is can't upset the system very much,The rate of processing just reached the rate of housing.,2
all they you know thinking that they're going to have money and jobs and success and everything and then they then there is no jobs and they end up homeless and not knowing anybody and no money and it's terrible,They think they'll have money and success but end up with nothing. ,2
but but it is peaceful i mean it is relaxing to do once you find the time to do it,It is very stressful.,1
yeah so i i trotted back to the car rather quickly uh jumped in went home and took a hot shower and changed clothes and went back,"I drove home and made supper, then went back.",1
yeah i mean this this Escort even when the head gasket went i mean it would start first time every time,"Once the head gasket went out, the Escort stopped working.",1
i'm not exactly sure,I'm not sure.,2
excessively violent i was worried it's like golly if kids start imitating that,"It was non-violent, so it would be great for the kids to follow their lead.",1
yeah maybe the maybe they'll bring their good schools with them  you know if the industry comes,"If the industry comes, they probably bring bad schools with them.",1
well uh normally i like to to go out fishing in a boat and uh rather than like bank fishing and just like you try and catch anything that's swimming because i've had such problems of trying to catch any type of fish that uh i just really enjoy doing the boat type fishing,I don't ever fish in my boat.,1
i don't understand that i thought that he was always a good player,I thought he was a better player than my brother. ,0
yeah because it like i i think i've seen those before but i don't remember what they look like,I think I've seen them before but I don't recall what they look like.,2
what does um is Robby Robin Williams does he have a funny part in the movie or is,How much went into making the movie?,0
but you know they kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that and and they don't follow it at all you know there're very few scouts go on and become Eagle Scouts and and i don't know what the high rank is for the gals but,The highest rank for Girl Scouts is Hawk Scout.,0
and oh okay and then went to Colorado,After that I left for Colorado.,2
yeah and they've got those bins that just stay there and they decorated them real cute you know with a bunch of big old flowers and stuff,"The bins just stay there and are decorated, I'm not sure if the decorations help.",0
but i've lived up here all my life and i'm fifty eight years old so i i could,I have lived in this place for fifty eight years.,2
course the head bangers i stay away from those entirely,I try to completely avoid the head bangers.,2
couple of years ago i was thinking about moving to Massachusetts but uh boy i'm glad i didn't,I may move to New Hampshire.,0
sometimes well there's definitely a lot more hitting,The man says that there's a lot more hitting.,0
although the uh it's uh it we almost one day we painted the house to uh we painted we painted the whole inside and it had all this dark trim we thought uh you know we did the one wall but the other trim i'm trying to think i think i think we left most of it because it gets to be uh they don't do that in the newer houses now we don't the uh mold everything is white in a new house everything is white,It takes a day to paint the house.,0
so Eric what do you think um,"What do you think, Eric?",2
yeah uh-huh yeah it's one of the things uh if you read in the newspapers and stuff he's the critics really like it or they really don't, None of the critics like that one ,1
no i i even i enjoy reading T News i try to catch it because it's another example they just they just show you the words and the facts and they they don't offer any commentary and it gives me a quick chance to to be caught up during the day because you know we don't listen to the radio at work at all so i don't like to go the whole day without hearing anything,I always check my phone for the news when I am on break.,0
now that's a good idea,That's a really bad idea.,1
they eat a lot of it you know you can take your vitamins and she was telling me to take zinc so anyway i've been taking enough zinc you know  to kill a horse probably  i hope it doesn't hurt me but anyway  i did read one chapter of that,I was told to take zinc.,2
but you're without a paycheck during that time and i don't at least that's my understanding is even you know the first time you go for counseling and it's six weeks before you're back to work,You don't have a paycheck for six week if you go.,2
well so okay you need to get married and have kids and then when they're big enough you can have them go do the yard  and you can do what you want to do,Children are never too young to do yardwork.,1
yeah it's just a matter of education i think,Yeah but education doesn't matter.,1
he was he's of course uh i guess he's trained in this uh martial arts of some sort but the plot was bland the acting was bland It was just mostly centered upon his abilities to,The plot was boring because he was a bad actor.  ,0
yeah no i don't know if there's any any series that i pay attention to i try to watch Cheers once in a while,"I watch Cheers everynow and then, but I don't watch many series.",2
when there was the ball that was sort of hit to Buckner to Buckner,The ball was hit to Buckner.,2
so you um-hum so you think it comes down to education or or something like that,It has nothing to do with education.,1
but you're without a paycheck during that time and i don't at least that's my understanding is even you know the first time you go for counseling and it's six weeks before you're back to work,You go to counciling?,0
so it's it's changing and the summers are getting hot and the winters are cold but i guess i can live with it,I can cope with the hot summers and the cold winters.,2
maybe adult literacy maybe you know composition writing maybe you know uh volunteering you know on a tutor line or though the even through the elementary schools for help with homework or the other part of me says is God i've had enough kids  do i really,I don't know if I really want to put in more effort volunteering since I've already gone through that with my children,0
and uh it that takes so much time away from your kids,Takes you away from your kids because it is more important to you.,0
oh i'll bet they did,I'm bet they did after getting into trouble. ,0
and uh really they're about it they've got a guy named Herb Williams that that i guess sort of was supposed to take the place of uh Tarpley but he uh he just doesn't have the offensive skills,"If Herb Williams had more offensive skills, he would have taken Tarpley's place.",2
it takes so much i mean it's like of course it does i mean by the times it transforms into Wave by mark off model and you put it in there and you want to correct those and then you know you're trying to make the the Wave smooth so you can approximately of course it's going to take a lot,It takes a lot.,2
yeah it's definitely a way out of the way where  where as,I was able to find my way out of the corn maze,0
yeah the the i mean people like that are crazy i did a study on it though when i was in high school it was one of these things we had to pick a topic to to investigate and at that time i don't think it's like that any more but at that time uh it was very unfair capital punishment was a lot more  common and if you tended and it tended to be that if you were ignorant or if you were a foreigner or if you were black or any minority for that matter the chances your chances of of uh getting the death penalty were you know like hundreds of times greater than if you could just communicate well i mean you didn't have to be um you didn't even necessarily have to be white but if you could just communicate and you could come across in the court room with some kind of um,It was something I performed research on during high school.,2
and uh as a matter of fact he's a draft dodger,He avoided the military draft of 1943 when the need was highest.,0
well that's not why i got it right  how do you like your tread mill,That is not the reason I got it.,2
kind of like for the same reasons as you i just the care that goes into them and you know if i you know decide to take off for a week or so,I don't care what goes into them. ,1
and uh well if you if you got got him a power mower it'd probably take him a lot less time to do it but i enjoy doing it i feel good doing it uh i i feel a lot better doing it with a power mower with that with a  with a pull tractor on it so i don't have to push so hard,"Keeping the old push mower is the best idea, since it gets the job done as fast as a power mower.",1
yeah no i don't know if there's any any series that i pay attention to i try to watch Cheers once in a while,I watch a ton of series.,1
you know it's it's not easy to do but,It can be challenging.,2
so they don't deal much in cash anymore either,So they don't use cash a lot anymore.,2
yeah they're still laying off like over in Fort Worth and a lot of other companies too just here and there,No one has been laid off in Fort Worth.,1
you know and he he was talking about that he was talking about nobody went broke over paying thirty percent,He talked about how everybody who paid 30 percent eventually went broke.,1
well that's right because uh one day it'll be eighty and the next day it'll be about thirty below i tell you what and uh,In the eastern United States the temperature often changes quickly.,0
well the channel eight when they came here thirteen fourteen years ago Dave Fox and Tracy Rowlett came together uh from Oklahoma City and apparently channel eight was way down and now they have turned it all around and done a pretty remarkable job and then,We don't have a Channel 8.,1
so he donates a lot not everything but a lot of the material then what he doesn't donate we just go out and buy,He donates all of the material.,1
and uh it may be a Mexican pizza sometimes both together um along with and see it which is really funny too you know normally she goes straight for vegetables except when she's having French fries,She often eats meat unless she's having water.,1
yeah i think they get bogged down in a lot of small issues that people you know special interest groups can blow up,They're snowed under by small issues blown out of proportion by special interest groups.,2
yeah yeah i i went i went off to school wanting to either be a high school algebra teacher or high school French teacher because my two favorite people in the in high school were my algebra teacher and French teacher and uh and i was going to do that until the end of our sophomore year when we wanted uh we came time to sign up for majors and i had taken chemistry for the first time that year and surprised myself i did well in it,You are required to sign up for a major freshman year. ,1
uh well i figured if i had it done in the garage at the Toyota dealer i would be looking at probably three or four hundred dollars,The dealer would have charged a few hundred dollars.,2
well the floor was uneven you know,"well, you know that part of the floor sits half an inch higher than the other part",0
yes it is kind it is family and it's fun it's a fun thing and kids enjoy that and,"It involves the family, it is fun, and kids love that.",2
well and i i noticed since we moved down here to Texas my husband is originally from Texas but uh i'm not and that you don't have to have uh such a wide variety of seasonal clothes that you do up north where you have to,Texans always have a wide variety of seasonal clothes. ,1
if it had rained any more in the last two weeks instead of planting Saint Augustine grass in the front yard i think i would have plowed everything under and had a rice field,It's rained enough to make a rice patty.,2
well they're so close to an undefeated undefeated season they can taste it and they wanna make history so i don't think they're gonna lack for motivation,Their recent losses took their toll on their morale.,1
the the Iranian borders are still open uh from what i understand understand um,Iran let their borders open due to a crisis.,0
some of the professors i think imitate Big Bird,The professors like how cool Big Bird is.,0
oh of course,Of course,2
um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah yeah it is i don't know i think it's a very interesting um discussion you know and and there's certainly uh lots of pros and cons around it,The pros and cons around this issue have been stunning to my friends.,0
yeah and the music and uh well it had an excellent story line Everything about it was good,there wasn't anything good about it,1
well i i'm doing computer science computer engineering,I am currently majoring in Biology at school.,1
so that's that's one of your priorities there's got to be air has to be an automatic,One of your priorities should be automatic air.,2
in one sense um i'm i'm an older person in my fifties so i feel that we've lost some things in the sense that women have to work today,My views as someone who's 50 are not modern.,0
but like they always say you know got a good profit sharing plan just no profit,This profit sharing plan sounds like a scam.,0
and not only that it it opens you to phone solicitations,It also opens the door to move marketing calls.,2
yeah well i i started uh studying mathematics basically because i was really good at that in high school,I was also a straight-A student.,0
i ripped the ligaments in my right ankle,i tore the ligaments in my right ankle,2
um-hum yeah that's very true you know how many is it they say we have so many lawyers in this country and i guess i i live near Washington being in in Baltimore it's something like one in four people in the Washington,There are a lot of lawyers in this country.,2
oh  that's accommodating,That is disruptive.,1
so Eric what do you think um,"Do you have a brain, Eric?",1
you know we keep a couple hundred dollars um if that much charged on those which isn't too bad it's just your normal,"We have money on there, which isn't great",1
it's the very same type of paint and everything,"It's a different colour, but the same paint formula",0
so who so if you go out and you're talking like a ten or fifteen thousand dollar vehicle and you add that sales tax on that's a that's a big chunk of change you have to come up with,"If you add sales tax to a ten thousand dollar vehicle, that a lot of money.",2
but i don't know you know  maybe you could do that for a certain period of time but i mean how long does that kind of a thing take you know to to um say to question the person or to get into their head,It's not worth doing if you have to question the person like that.,0
uh uh yeah that well um the older you get the more convenience you try to bring with you i guess so i'm up to dragging the trailer around which is my next step is going to be probably Winnebago i hope if i only can afford one but that,"The older you get, the more you want to be spur of the moment.",0
there's certain times of the year of course that uh that it probably wouldn't do very well because of the temperature and stuff but but uh the right time of year it works pretty good,"At the right time of year, this paint is great.",0
yeah that's a nice place,It's awful and has no redeeming qualities. ,1
yes that i think that's true so that makes them feel definitely like outsiders but like getting back to the their government benefits they they do have a lot of uh tax benefits,They receive more tax benefits then anyone else. ,0
yeah and i'll do this uh sometimes i'll put my after I pour that into my back into my saucepan i'll put the eggs in the same dish and beat them up and then pour the cornstarch and the milk mixture in the egg so,Sometimes I put the eggs in the same dish and add the cornstarch.,2
yeah well i can't i'll you know i say i can't wait for my kids to grow up but i believe i'm going to miss this age when they're gone,I can not wait for my kids to grow up.,2
yes that i think that's true so that makes them feel definitely like outsiders but like getting back to the their government benefits they they do have a lot of uh tax benefits,I think that makes them feel like outsiders but on the other hand they do receive a lot of tax benefits. ,2
um-hum with the ice yeah,With the snow as well.,0
and he's an engineer so he even came over and set it up for me and had it running for like two hundred dollars so i thought that,It took me hours to figure out how to set it up myself.,1
i understand i can imagine you all have much trouble up there with insects or,I can imagine how you are troubled by insects up there,2
you know like CODA comes out of your out of your pay and the credit union comes out of your pay so we don't have to do anything there and the rest of it as far as my salary goes i just have it automatically deposited in into our bank,What remains of my salary goes into our bank.,2
and maybe we'll run across each other again,Perhaps we will cross paths in the future.,2
how long has he been in his present position,What length of time has he held the current position?,2
yeah well that's the other thing you know they talk about women leaving the home and going out to work well still taking care of the children is a very important job and and someone's got to do it and be able to do it right and,Traditional gender roles were correct all along.,0
they'll they'll say yeah why didn't you buy why didn't you try something more mainline,They'll wonder why you didn't do a more mainline clothing line.,0
you did you see that,I saw that!,0
what was the problem,What was the issue?,2
i guess it's just you know and when i think about that lady this this particular lady who wrote me a check for twelve dollars and it bounced and i sent it through you know sent it through the check through the bank once and she incurred at least a fifteen dollar fee,The lady incurred a 15 dollar fee when she wrote me a bad 12 dollar check.,2
well no see i'm from a town named Panhandle,The town I'm from is Panhandle.,2
yeah well my uh my uh probably one of the biggest decisions i think that was very strengthened for our family was rather than have one child make that decision,A very big decision strengthens our family.,2
does does that make since to you,Are you confused about what this means?,2
yeah plus uh you know look at the you know the besides the pollution the the aspect of invasion of privacy there's a big pollution aspect too i find i throw out a lot of those flyers and i have no interest in,I don't think that flyers are a big deal.,1
i mean i'm i'm sort of strange in a way i'm i'm about twenty pounds overweight and i smoke but my blood pressure is about my last reading was just the other day it was one hundred two over seventy nine,I smoke and am overweight. My last blood pressure reading was 102 over 79. ,2
is that what you ended up going into,How did you decide to do that?,0
i agree with you but did you see the map they drew up on uh on how they were gonna divide up the districts,They didn't draw anything.,1
and they just put instructors out there and you you sign up for instruction and they just give you an arm band and if you see an instructor who's not doing anything you just tap him on the shoulder and ask him questions and they'll show you things,"The instructors are marked with armbands, and anytime you want to know anything, you just find one of them. ",1
you'd be crazy if you trust them but anyway call it what is it McCarthyism no  i'm not like that i just got enough common sense that nope to you come repent make a world apology for all the wrongs that you've done and yeah we've done wrongs but we've not done near the atrocities they've done and we need to maybe do that also you know,"I may appear as racist, but we are suffering from a very real threat.",0
it depends a lot of uh a lot of things were thought that uh as you know the farmers thought okay we got chemicals we're putting chemicals on the field well the ground will naturally filter out the,"Even if farmers put chemicals in the ground, the ground eventually filters them out.",2
right well the warmth that developed between them and again it i think was a picture of relationships,There was a mutual feeling in their relationship.,2
yeah really no kidding,It's crazy! ,0
well Jerry do you have a favorite team,"Jerry, why do you hate sports?",1
you know things like that But i don't follow any team i check the scores the next morning and i know how everybody's doing and that suffices me But,I don't usually watch the games that are screened at night.,0
oh uh-huh well no they wouldn't would they no,"No, they wouldn't.",2
um i've visited the Wyoming area i'm not sure exactly where Dances with Wolves was filmed,I know exactly where Dances with Wolves was filmed.,1
substitute my my yeah my kid'll do uh four or five hours this week for me no problem,I won't be substituting anything in this case.,1
oh older ones too i know a few of those,I know a few older ones from when I lived there.,0
so i how do you feel that it should be applied,With application how do you think it should be done?,2
oh really it wouldn't matter if we plant them when it was starting to get warmer,Warmer weather doesn't alter planting time.,2
during the whole war he never put out like a conservation a conservation effort for oil,The whole war we guarded the oil and tried to steal it.,1
because i always had to do it and so i just pay someone else to do it and they do the they do the cutting they fertilize they um edge and um i think this year i'm going to have some landscaping put in,I have never developed a love for gardening. ,0
they don't call them immigrants anymore that was back during my granddaddy's day,They used to call them immigrants.,2
yeah okay you go ahead,"No, do not go ahead.",1
it's the very same type of paint and everything,"It's the same paint formula, it's great!",2
and i don't think they've repainted since,I'm not sure if they've repainted it since.,2
yeah it's definitely a way out of the way where  where as,Yes. There is definitely a way out.,2
more than anything else in this day and age that's got to be a big factor in your decision's just the the cost of how much you're gonna pay,"In your decisions age is a big factor, and I agree with you thoughts",0
it sure will well good to talk to,Let's talk again soon.,0
and the other thing is the cost it's almost prohibitive to bring it to a dealer,The cost makes it hard to bring it to a dealer.,2
i don't know if you have a place there called uh or you probably have something similar we call it Service Merchandise,You probably have nothing like it.,0
oh older ones too i know a few of those,I know a few old ones.,2
yeah that's that's always nice when you have an animal that the kids can play with like that how old are the kids,It's good for kids to have a dog. ,0
that's really true a lot of it is um the color certain colors seem to be more acceptable,It doesn't make a difference what color one wears. ,1
huh-uh the the yeah see the Taurus Show has the spoiler kit and the and the big engine and the and stuff like that,The Taurus show had some spoiler kits.,2
so we're expecting our local economy to,We have no expectations of our local economy.,1
no i i just painted,I just painted a huge mural depicting a tiger empaling a small dog. ,0
oh i believe that uh mine would say the same uh but uh i seem too rely on them too much,I believe you and my kids would say the same thing but I think I might rely too much on their loyalty. ,0
so who so if you go out and you're talking like a ten or fifteen thousand dollar vehicle and you add that sales tax on that's a that's a big chunk of change you have to come up with,Adding sales tax to a ten thousand dollar vehicle is not significant.,1
i think we have too thank you very much you too bye-bye,I don't think we can thank you enough for your help.,0
actually i think abortion's going to take a turn where there's not going to be as many because i think contraceptives are going to be more popular i mean i realize that they are popular now but i think,The rise in the use of contraceptives will push the abortion rate even higher.,1
and maybe we'll run across each other again,We should do coffee if we ever meet again.,0
no it didn't,It did not.,2
uh but you could fill a whole bunch of uh holes with these things i used to i used to advertise buying wheat pennies um i'd give a dollar a roll which two cents a piece which is basically overpriced,I made a good dollar while selling them.,0
they take the football serious,They think football is meaningless.,1
right after the war,The war was too long.,0
now that's a good idea,The idea is a good one.,2
away from the children,No adults allowed near the children,0
my goodness it's hard to believe i didn't think there was anybody in the country who hadn't seen that one,I thought I was the only one in this country who had seen it. ,1
um-hum they have socialized socialized health care,They have socialized health care since 1957,0
i spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst,I was only briefly in the service as a driver.,1
you know things like that But i don't follow any team i check the scores the next morning and i know how everybody's doing and that suffices me But,It is enough for me to just check the scores in the morning.,2
yeah the the i mean people like that are crazy i did a study on it though when i was in high school it was one of these things we had to pick a topic to to investigate and at that time i don't think it's like that any more but at that time uh it was very unfair capital punishment was a lot more  common and if you tended and it tended to be that if you were ignorant or if you were a foreigner or if you were black or any minority for that matter the chances your chances of of uh getting the death penalty were you know like hundreds of times greater than if you could just communicate well i mean you didn't have to be um you didn't even necessarily have to be white but if you could just communicate and you could come across in the court room with some kind of um,"I never attended school, mom wouldn't let me.",1
yeah i've always threatened to take lessons but i've never gotten around to it,I threaten my wife to take lessons on how to cook so that she can't cook anymore. ,0
it gets it,I guess it gets sunlight sometimes.,0
yeah right uh-huh that's right yeah you you have to work on you really do,You don't really have to work at it.,1
yeah i do remember that and uh i remember as a kid my parents watching the Ed Sullivan Show that was really the big deal in our household was the Ed Sullivan Show yeah i guess i guess it was a Saturday night and i went to see the movie The Doors a couple of days ago and they had this scene,I remember watching the Ed Sullivan Show when I was a kid.,2
but we're taking our time we're going uh try to make our decision by July,We are thinking of making the decision tomorrow.,1
right right they left a woman and a child or the cat the sheep yeah,"They were merciful in this regard, only taking the men as slaves.",0
what do you think about uh about our new governor since she happens to be a female,"What do you think about our governor, regardless of the fact that she's female.",1
yes that i think that's true so that makes them feel definitely like outsiders but like getting back to the their government benefits they they do have a lot of uh tax benefits,"They definitely feel included, but they don't have any tax benefits. ",1
well Jerry do you have a favorite team,"Jerry, do you follow any sports?",0
in our town of five thousand we have one that is uh local FM AM station and their news is fed from CNN too uh it's more of uh,The town radio station never relied on any national news sources.,1
i don't know how what it would take to be come up with a true perfect system or if one exists but,I can give you the solution that is the perfect answer.,1
they ought to take all them little misdemeanor people let them go let them go,they shouldn't let go of the misdemeanor people,1
what do you think about uh about our new governor since she happens to be a female,What do you think of our new female governor?,2
it's neat when you think about how she wrote it and stuff otherwise the lyrics are kind of,How she wrote it was pretty cool. ,2
they don't call them immigrants anymore that was back during my granddaddy's day,They never called them immigrants.,1
we have tickets waiting for us,We have tickets to the Browns waiting for us.,0
yeah although i do worry that how easy this one was might be a bad lesson uh to the to the younger people um you know than there is the other generation,I do worry that it might be a bad lesson.,2
is there still that type of music available,Is that genre of music still a thing?,2
i don't know if you have a place there called uh or you probably have something similar we call it Service Merchandise,There is usually a similar place anywhere you go.,0
but uh that has been the major change that we have noticed in gardening and that's about the extent of what we've done just a little bit on the patio and uh and waiting for the the rain to subside so we can  mow we after about a month we finally got to mow this weekend,We have not done much gardening yet because of the rain.,2
and i use a one of those black soaker hoses that actually oozes water every where so i lace it up and down there a couple of times and i only have to water about two hours a week,"I takes me just about half an hour to water, and I do it once a week.",1
you know it took away a lot of of time from them we did go out to you know to the places that you typically take children to and we had a lot of fun but it seems as though the time went by so fast that,Time went by too fast while we were having fun with the kids.,2
because then they'll or you have a prescription,Either way you won't have a prescription.,1
did oh they're they are everywhere they,They spread out.,0
uh and i think even Electric Light Orchestra had some some real um influences by classical music and i'm still still my favorite in fact most of my CDs that i got are classical music,Most of my CDs are songs of birds dying in the wild. ,1
yeah exactly right it really is because they're gonna get them one way or another they will always have a way look at drugs they always have a way to get that so,"They are going to get them one way or another, they always have a way to get drugs.",2
and uh the whole organization was targeting to replace whole life policies with a term life with annuity an annuity and uh,Whole life policies with a term life with annuity could be replaced by the whole organization with something more complicated.,0
and uh well if you if you got got him a power mower it'd probably take him a lot less time to do it but i enjoy doing it i feel good doing it uh i i feel a lot better doing it with a power mower with that with a  with a pull tractor on it so i don't have to push so hard,Buying him a power mower would probably help him finish the job sooner.,2
yeah i can believe that,I agree with what you said.,2
you know they they like what they're doing they you know they feel good about what they're doing that type of thing it's more,You can see that they hate this line of work.,1
my goodness it's hard to believe i didn't think there was anybody in the country who hadn't seen that one,"Wow, I didn't think it was possible for someone in the country to not have seen that. ",2
right yeah that's it's always handy to have that that credit card for whatever it is that you might need it for,It is always convenient to have a credit card.,2
that was good and Poland yeah and i've done some of those yeah i like i like things that are those are a few of the ones i can take of his i like it when they actually are giving you information in a novel format i guess would be the,I enjoy receiving information in the shape of a novel.,2
yeah i think i'll probably just have to go with one of those splint braces or something,I don't need a splint brace. ,1
actually i listened to one time i remember it's this is back when rap even uh i would say about ten or fifteen years ago i,"About 15 years ago  I listened to Rap one time, I am not really that fond of it,",0
oh hum well uh i haven't for some reason have never really gotten enthused about football in the summer from from the the World League,I am very excited about football in the summer.,1
and the wind started blowing and it was one of my earlier trips to be really out in the middle of,I was scared and wanted to go home.,0
i've yeah i've done it before and when i was in high in high school and college and thoroughly enjoyed it and and it's really a a blast my wife hates it but that's the way life is i guess,I've done it in the past and really liked it. ,2
but i think a lot of kids it's funny get the same kind of fears like there's somebody under the bed,I'm sure most children don't think it's amusing at all.,0
that's neat just supervised more or less than anything and security i guess for them,They made sure the place was secure all night long.,0
i quit i quit drinking at oh a long time ago quit drinking i didn't smoke i don't smoke i gave everything up so i guess i don't know what just old age i guess is why i,I quit drinking and smoking an felt better but I guess it is just old age.,0
they eat a lot of it you know you can take your vitamins and she was telling me to take zinc so anyway i've been taking enough zinc you know  to kill a horse probably  i hope it doesn't hurt me but anyway  i did read one chapter of that,The author advised that zinc supplements are good for health.,2
okay movies i've i haven't seen too many lately i have kids and we went and saw The Rescuers Down Under over the the break do do you have kids you take to movies or,I took my kids to see the movie The Rescuers Down Under.,2
they just didn't watch him on TV,They didn't watch him on TV.,2
and oh okay and then went to Colorado,The poor local job market pushed me to move to the booming state of Colorado.,0
but uh i've always enjoyed uh the train and you know fooling with it and all,I have always liked the train and messing around with it.,2
and uh it may be a Mexican pizza sometimes both together um along with and see it which is really funny too you know normally she goes straight for vegetables except when she's having French fries,French fries very popular in this country.,0
right right they left a woman and a child or the cat the sheep yeah,"No one was left behind, no animal either.",1
so it's sociology,So it's social science ,2
well that's good that's great,"That is not bad, it is actually pretty good.",2
i bet it was that they do that you know they they have kittens out there in the garage or out in the barn and the first time you try to get around the kittens you know it's you'd have to catch them with a uh a fish net or something because they scamper away so quick,The prey is meant to be eaten.,1
no nobody's going to bother you,Everyone is going to nag you about it. ,1
my parents uh were sailing uh this last year down off uh Costa Rica and they took about two weeks and went into i don't even know the name of the river there but they went white water rafting and Mom said it was absolutely just a wonderful experience she said it was truly incredible,This last year my parents went sailing near Costa Rica.,2
no i i i don't i it completely beyond me i went to my under graduate uh education,I was thinking of other things so I can't recall.,0
um-hum yeah i know what that's like uh-huh,I have no idea what that is like.,1
uh but you could fill a whole bunch of uh holes with these things i used to i used to advertise buying wheat pennies um i'd give a dollar a roll which two cents a piece which is basically overpriced,I used to try to sell wheat pennies.,1
yeah well are you you with TI,Yeah well are you with the FBI?,1
yeah well i'm a hot weather person i'm i can take the heat but i don't like the cold,I can handle hot weather but I am not fond of the cold.  ,2
huh do you have your own kiln or do you do you,"You don't have a kiln, do you?",2
well so okay you need to get married and have kids and then when they're big enough you can have them go do the yard  and you can do what you want to do,The reason to have children is so that they can do yardwork.,2
right and that was back in nineteen fifty nine,It will be in the future.,1
true yeah i know it isn't that ridiculous we have cable which helps a lot,We have had cable for the past five years.,0
the hologram makes up all these things and uh i mean sometimes  sometimes it's funny sometimes it's not but uh you know it's something to pass the time until we do and then and then we watch football,We have nothing to do but stare at the walls til the game starts.,1
oh of course,Of course she will ,0
yeah i'm trying to find out how long we're supposed talk,We need to talk a lot.,0
but you know they kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that and and they don't follow it at all you know there're very few scouts go on and become Eagle Scouts and and i don't know what the high rank is for the gals but,Many kids leave the Scouts when they are pre-teens.,2
and then i got into it and then back out of it and it it just seems like every couple of years i get back in there,I have been into it on and off in the past years.,2
uh i don't know i i have mixed emotions about him uh sometimes i like him but at the same times i love to see somebody beat him,"I think he is good, but not the best.",0
yeah because those things i think would just snap you know,Because they would break.,2
it's like but the time we went to Florida and needed to rent a car you know he believed in it,We have never been to Florida.,1
yeah and then about every five years you have to dig them up and throw them away and start over again they don't last forever,they last forever.,1
life track,Jobs and work.,0
yes they would they just wouldn't be able to own the kind of automobiles that they think they deserve to own or the kind of homes that we think we deserve to own we might have to you know just be able to i think if we a generation went without debt then the next generation like if if our our generation my husband and i we're twenty eight if we lived our lives and didn't become you know indebted like you know our generation before us that um the budget would balance and that we became accustomed to living with what we could afford which we wouldn't be destitute i mean we wouldn't be living on the street by any means but just compared to how spoiled we are we would be in our own minds but i feel like the generation after us would oh man it it would be so good it would be so much better it wouldn't be perfect but then they could learn to live with what what they could afford to save to buy and if you want a nicer car than that well you save a little longer,Society would be perfect and there would be no more war if we could just rid ourselves of our debt.,0
i'll listen  and agree with what i think sounds right,I'll listen to the person talking about trains.,0
all they you know thinking that they're going to have money and jobs and success and everything and then they then there is no jobs and they end up homeless and not knowing anybody and no money and it's terrible,They don't contribute anything to society. ,0
right and uh there's usually nobody running against you know the incumbents,The incumbents are running completely unopposed by any other candidate.  ,2
it's just it's the morals of the people which i mean i guess we everybody's responsible for the society but if i had a child that that did things so bad it's not they don't care about anybody these people they're stealing from they're just the big bad rich guy,My kid would get caught stealing if they tried. ,0
um-hum they keep you entertained they sure do we have a uh my wife's uh mother is uh oh about  seventy seven i guess she really gets a thrill when we go over to see her and bring the dog i think she's more happy to see the dog than she is us,My wife's mother owns three dogs and loves ours too. ,0
yeah i can believe that,I will never believe in what you just said.,1
oh thank God i've never been to Midland,I haven't ever been to Midland. ,2
and uh we went through a time period that we had three Danes,"For a while, we had three Danes.",2
yeah um gosh i think it was only like three and a half pounds and for me that's big that's why i'm saying i love to go fishing because i've never caught anything really really big um so because it's always been you know in the on a lake and uh i know they have bigger fish than that but you know three and a half pounds and that was huge for me,It was just a few pounds but I ate it all.,0
i don't know how what it would take to be come up with a true perfect system or if one exists but,I don't know if one exists but I will do my best to research the matter.,0
i ripped the ligaments in my right ankle,"ever since i injured my right ankle, i can't put weight on it",0
because uh i know people who eat tons of that kind of stuff and they're just as healthy as can be,Anyone I know who eats that kind of stuff is very ill.,1
yeah well at least as they told us uh two shifts,They said there was only one shift.,1
they just didn't watch him on TV,They watched him on TV all the time. ,1
yeah that's that's a big step yeah,"No, that is an insignificant step.",1
oh boy it the i think it's like one or the other isn't it i mean you either,I think it's one or the other.,2
well no see i'm from a town named Panhandle,Panhandle is a town in Florida.,0
yeah TI people yeah and so i just figured no it's just this area you know,"No, I figured is was all areas.",1
once you have something and it's like i was watching this program on TV yesterday in nineteen seventy six NASA came up with Three D graphics right,The program aired on PBS.,0
with little back packs of their own and you know things like that,I'm not sure they're old enough to have back packs.,0
that's true um-hum well that's true the America's paying all this money to have other people give uh aid to other countries so they could be paying their own people and training their own people at the same time,"That's true, America's paying to for other folks to provide international aid so they could train and pay their own citizens at the same time.",2
yeah and the music and uh well it had an excellent story line Everything about it was good,"every aspect of it was amazing, the best i've ever seen",0
and uh i know what nothing is when i moved out there,I discovered what nothing was when I moved out there.,2
well i meant when when you were when you were growing up i mean like Galveston,You grew up in Tulsa.,1
down here it's been it's everybody's got colds and everything because it's cold one day and hot the next day,The temperatures have remained steady and no one is sick here.  ,1
yeah yeah you know we're kind of that way too i try to i'm the same way you are i kind of try to judge from day to day i know you know where i am we work a lot with the customers and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time and,We tend to deal with several customers as well as government staff.,2
um-hum yeah we're still pretty much you know in winter as far as that goes here,It's still pretty much winter here.,2
yeah no i don't know if there's any any series that i pay attention to i try to watch Cheers once in a while,"I don't like television much, I do like Cheers though.",2

and i look back on that and i bought shoes i went shopping i did not need that money i did not need it i didn't need it i shouldn't have even qualified to get it i didn't need it and it would have been a little rough i might have eaten some bologna instead of roast beef out of the deli but i did not need it and as i look back now now we're paying that back i told my son if you have to live in the ghetto to go to college do it but don't take out ten thousand dollars in loans don't do it and i don't i hope don't think he'll have to do that but i just so like we might if we didn't have those loans we could have saved in the last five years the money for that and i believe we would have because God's really put it in our heart not to get in debt you know but we have friends at church that do this on a constant basis that are totally debt free and they pay cash for everything they buy,I regret taking out loans.,2
uh-huh yeah yeah they're good,They were better before.,0
and uh oh i guess an hour into my somewhat sleep a guy woke me up and uh said you'd better get out of the the tent they're they're liable to come down several of the others had already come down blown down they hadn't blown away but they had flattened,A guy told me to get out because the tents were being flattened.,2

oh yeah IBM uh i mean uh a lot of people use human factors folks but IBM is what i'm looking at right now,I'm looking at IBM right now but I've looked at tons of other things.,0
hm oh is oh that's great uh-huh do you get the full benefits,I think that is horrible. ,1
but how do you know  the good from the bad,But how do you separate good from bad?,2
it doesn't have to do i mean the thing is is that you know it's like you might be standing somewhere right and like let's say you're you you go you know you're driving out and you're driving back home and it's late at night and you stop by one of these you know twenty four hour you know gas stations joints,There are no gas stations open 24 hours a day.,1
um well i hate to yes i do,I hate to.,2
yeah i know the motor oil,I am aware of the motor oil.,2
football and baseball and,Neither football nor baseball.,1

oh yeah well i play softball a couple of times a year it's they're getting ready to start up the the season again,They play softball alongside rounders usually,0
yeah yeah uh-huh yeah we we saw that one uh we find that uh that uh if you can get into those dollar movies you know they're uh they're a dollar and a half what is it dollar and a quarter dollar and a half now,I don't think you can get it anywhere.,1
no no but you know i was just thinking of getting one those for the yard because they they are really nice and um up here we have uh we have quite a few mosquitoes at nighttime,The mosquitoes are rough at night.,0
i don't even know how they figure it really i'm glad i don't work in a store,I'm happy that I don't work in a store.,2
you did you see that,No one saw it. ,1
uh unemployment runs approximately six percent,The rate of unemployment is insignificant.,0

where they they brew their own beer there,The beer brewed there is made by them. ,2
and the nurses aren't no see you have to pay that,You have to pay for that.,2
someone else noticed it and i said well i guess that's true and it was somewhat melodio us in other words it wasn't just you know it was really funny,Someone else paid attention to it and it was really funny. ,2
and have been back and every now and then some news filters in that they went to see some of the old things and of course the savings and loan program um that was that you know that that just continued to grow in fact after my group i mean we were just a very small specialized group too to get that going and spread and then of course Peace Corps bowed out of that because that's uh uh something that nationalized very quickly and the same with the coops,Every once in awhile some news comes in about the program.,2
but uh that has been the major change that we have noticed in gardening and that's about the extent of what we've done just a little bit on the patio and uh and waiting for the the rain to subside so we can  mow we after about a month we finally got to mow this weekend,We still won't be able to mow for a couple of weeks.,1
looking at that and you know and if it's if it's funny or if it keeps my interest if it's exciting i'll watch it if not i don't and times that i saw that or pieces of that it wasn't any it wasn't great Thirty Something i watched a few times because there was a few good episodes and then after that it it i just lost interest in it,"I watched Thirty Something a few times because some of the episodes were good, and then after that I lost interest in it.",2
you know like CODA comes out of your out of your pay and the credit union comes out of your pay so we don't have to do anything there and the rest of it as far as my salary goes i just have it automatically deposited in into our bank,"After CODA and credit union, nothing is left of my salary.",1
and we decided we'd just go across the road to the office and see if we could rent anything,We wanted to see if we could rent any of their campers.,0
as long as you got congressmen and senators that are getting kickbacks kickbacks from these different companies that are getting awarded for the defense contracts that's never going to happen,There is no corruption in government.,1
it can't last seven years but it can last five IBM says let's throw it away Leading Edge will say we'll buy it from you,The new computer wont last for seven years.,0
are you and since being Argentinean we also have a lot of pasta,Because we're Argentinean we like to eat pasta.,2
so we're expecting our local economy to,What we expect of our local economy is,2
ooh that does get high yeah i mean,"No, that stays pretty low overall. ",1
yeah because those things i think would just snap you know,Because they would survive easily.,1
because otherwise it's too it gets if you start them when it's cooler in the spring then it gets too hot in the summer,You should start them during Spring if you want them to be cool during the summer.,1
yeah yeah so it's interesting to talk to somebody from that general vicinity,There's no one to talk to round here because they're utterly boring.,1
and uh you know once you start up at the top and try to get those dollars on down to the hands that need them you know there's a lot of places the money stops and disappears along the way,All the money always gets into the hands of those who need it.,1
yeah yeah seven percent or something it depends on where you're at some places in Dallas i guess it's like closer to eight and places like in Lewisville it's a lot closer to seven,In Lewisville it is up around ten or so.,1
for me now the address is the same you know my my office address,I am unemployed.,1
yeah i've i wish they'd split that bowling season up into uh three seasons,I am happy with the bowling season schedule as is.,1

in each square,Inside every square.,2
so who so if you go out and you're talking like a ten or fifteen thousand dollar vehicle and you add that sales tax on that's a that's a big chunk of change you have to come up with,The sales tax would really drive the price of the car up.,2
i don't understand that i thought that he was always a good player,I always considered him to be a terrible player. ,1
but i think that's probably a good idea,I believe that is potentially a great idea.,2
from grocery store baggers that want to buy my car because it's a Trans Am they're high school seniors seventeen years old and they got to impress their girl friend,My Trans Am isn't popular at all.,1
probably yeah i would imagine the judge could throw it out,I would guess that the judge would be able to toss that out.,2
that's true um-hum well that's true the America's paying all this money to have other people give uh aid to other countries so they could be paying their own people and training their own people at the same time,America has spent nothing on foreign aid so how would they be able to train and pay their own people.,1
yeah that's the World League,The World League is that.,2
well wonderful that'll be a musician,That will be a musician but before it was an orange. ,0
well that's pretty typical though uh i don't uh i don't guess it's going to be any much different uh than than it has been in the past so i expect uh July and August we'll see our  or uh share of hundred degree days,I hate the hundred degree days but we get them.,0
right that's that's supposedly,"No, not possible.  ",1
and i use a one of those black soaker hoses that actually oozes water every where so i lace it up and down there a couple of times and i only have to water about two hours a week,"I only have to water about two hours a week, except on rainy weeks.",0
yeah because i was saying to him i said i'm not that heavy i'm not heavy you know maybe ten to fifteen pounds like any other human being,"i could lose ten or fifteen pounds, like most other people",2
oh i enjoyed it i mean it was just more for my money,It was worth the money for the time.,0
oh i believe that uh mine would say the same uh but uh i seem too rely on them too much,"Oh no way, I do not believe that and you can be sure mine would say the opposite. ",1
well the floor was uneven you know,the floor was perfectly smooth and flat,1
couple of years ago i was thinking about moving to Massachusetts but uh boy i'm glad i didn't,I'm glad that I didn't move to Massachusetts.,2
i have been and uh some of the boy scouts have been up in there they have got some great hiking trails and camping areas up in there,Boy scouts always know the best place to camp and hike. ,0
okay i guess we're on,"From your tone of voice, I could only assume that you want to go through with this, right?",0
yeah i it just totally ridiculous i mean the Israeli's could have fixed the whole problem years ago if they just sent sent their guys in there and killed Saddam,They Israelis didn't do it because they knew they could save money getting the States to do it.,0
oh you went to the dollar movie yeah yeah they show up at the dollar movie right after they get come out you know they're usually not not that great or didn't do that great anyway let me see let me see another movie i watched uh i want to see is uh that new one uh,they are shown at the dollar movie theater immediately after they're released,2
yeah that's probably a  a little bit under what it is for this time of year i i think i haven't seen the weather the news the weather on the news in the evening lately but i think the average high would be it should be about seventy,All I do is watch the weather channel and I'm totally up to date on it.,1
yeah well Rochester's like right on the shores isn't it,Rochester is right on the shores of the great lakes.,0
God i'm envious,"God, I'm glad I don't have that.",1
yeah that's probably a  a little bit under what it is for this time of year i i think i haven't seen the weather the news the weather on the news in the evening lately but i think the average high would be it should be about seventy,I have not viewed the weather lately on the evening news.,2
defiantly if you live in an apartment right,Unless you live in a house.,0
kind of like for the same reasons as you i just the care that goes into them and you know if i you know decide to take off for a week or so,"Just like you , I'm invested in what goes into them even if you are not there for the next week or even the next year. ",0
and i look back on that and i bought shoes i went shopping i did not need that money i did not need it i didn't need it i shouldn't have even qualified to get it i didn't need it and it would have been a little rough i might have eaten some bologna instead of roast beef out of the deli but i did not need it and as i look back now now we're paying that back i told my son if you have to live in the ghetto to go to college do it but don't take out ten thousand dollars in loans don't do it and i don't i hope don't think he'll have to do that but i just so like we might if we didn't have those loans we could have saved in the last five years the money for that and i believe we would have because God's really put it in our heart not to get in debt you know but we have friends at church that do this on a constant basis that are totally debt free and they pay cash for everything they buy,I am envious of all my debt-free churchgoing friends.,0
oh yeah well i play softball a couple of times a year it's they're getting ready to start up the the season again,They play softball a couple of times per year,2
uh wasn't that Jane Eyre no he wrote Jane Eyre too,He did not write Jane Eyre or any other book.,1
i think that yeah i think and i i think that's real important,"""I think that it's not something we should be bothered with.""",1
and they're fairly close to the water aren't they i mean they're right on the late,They are on the waterside aren't they.,2
well we bought this with credit too  well we found it with a clearance uh down in Memphis i guess and uh,We bought items in Memphis using cash. ,1
oh that's not really important the the other stuff is just you know window dressing because we we've never ordered anything fact the the van that we've got we bought uh from an estate it was an estate trade uh it was almost brand new the the gentlemen who owned it had died,Our van was obtained through an estate trade after its owner had died.,2
that's uh only way to do it,There is no other way to do it.,2
it can't last seven years but it can last five IBM says let's throw it away Leading Edge will say we'll buy it from you,It is not going to be able to last seven years.,2
yes i i always turn on the TV set and it seems like i catch that program in the last five minutes and,I often find myself catching only the last five minutes of that program.,2
i think yeah and it's a just a nice escape and you know it's something to laugh at and enjoy,I think it's an escape that can be enjoyed.,2
okay what types of music do you like to listen to,what kind of music do you like?,2
so are can i just ask you are you Canadian,Are you from Canada?,2
defiantly if you live in an apartment right,"If you live in apartment, defiantly, right?",2
uh unemployment runs approximately six percent,The rate of unemployment is about six percent,2
you know even even into major things just to keep our car longer because i don't think we get the money that we put into them out of them in two years or three years and of course i was never in a position where i could trade my car off every two years,I have never been able to trade my car off every couple of years.,2
yeah i was in Peru Peru but um i there weren't as i recall or at least i wasn't aware of that many Americans there except for a very heavy concentration of Peace Corps volunteers this was when the Peace Corps first are started and it was one of the big targets,"I was an outsider looking in, a foreigner peering through a window.",0
oh i've never itemized yet,I always itemize.,1
yeah uh-huh yeah it's one of the things uh if you read in the newspapers and stuff he's the critics really like it or they really don't, The critics either like or really dislike that one but I liked it ,0
um-hum yes i was amazed we spent the only time we played on our trip was in Douglas Arizona and uh that was just,"We spent a lot of time in Douglas, Arizona during our trip.",0
and the NIT semifinals are on tonight,The NIT semifinals take place tonight.,2
i've yeah i've done it before and when i was in high in high school and college and thoroughly enjoyed it and and it's really a a blast my wife hates it but that's the way life is i guess,I've never done it and don't think I would like it. ,1
yeah uh-huh yeah it's one of the things uh if you read in the newspapers and stuff he's the critics really like it or they really don't, The critics either like or really dislike that one.,2
um-hum yeah that's very true you know how many is it they say we have so many lawyers in this country and i guess i i live near Washington being in in Baltimore it's something like one in four people in the Washington,There are barely any lawyers in this country.,1
you know maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place you know like the no new taxes thing you know that's uh with the economy going the way it is and everything that was nearly ridiculous thing to,it's possible to have no new taxes with the way the economy is right now.,1
uh yeah they were uh they were very good i was impressed,"Anyone could do what they did, I was bored.",1
actually i listened to one time i remember it's this is back when rap even uh i would say about ten or fifteen years ago i,I listened to rap one time about 15 years ago.,2
um-hum you mean when the reporter sticks the the microphone in the person says the face and says how do you feel that you house has burned to the ground,Reporters often confront people with difficult questions about events.,2
yeah most mine generally stay in the windows they're they're,mine are most often in the windows,2
no i mean there there there was nothing to it i mean,I did it because I wanted to and I could.,0
yeah that's that's always nice when you have an animal that the kids can play with like that how old are the kids,It's never nice for kids to have animals to play with. ,1
uh my uh roommate took a voice over course,The roommate was hoping to receive a certification in voice overs. ,0
and it just depends on how bad that person is,It depends on the condition of the person.,2
so you know it's something we we have tried to help but yeah,"If they didn't care, neither did we.",1
oh like if they say i i we just type it in like that,The typing is the easy part.,0
because like Tech is known to be a good engineering school and A and M maybe is known more for computers,A and M's computer department isn't very well regarded.,1
although the uh it's uh it we almost one day we painted the house to uh we painted we painted the whole inside and it had all this dark trim we thought uh you know we did the one wall but the other trim i'm trying to think i think i think we left most of it because it gets to be uh they don't do that in the newer houses now we don't the uh mold everything is white in a new house everything is white,We painted the house over the duration of one day.,2
we only have to get up for you know for the daytime feedings,We only have to get up for the daytime feedings.,2
in our town of five thousand we have one that is uh local FM AM station and their news is fed from CNN too uh it's more of uh,The local town's radio station relied on CNN for news.,2
excessively violent i was worried it's like golly if kids start imitating that,It was so violent I worried about the kids imitating that.,2
no never heard of it,He does not know what it is.,0
i think it's ninety two,There is no way it could be on ninety two.,1
and uh my daughter gets irate when i when i do that because you know she's a teenager,My daughter does sometimes have reason to be upset.,0
yeah i do remember that and uh i remember as a kid my parents watching the Ed Sullivan Show that was really the big deal in our household was the Ed Sullivan Show yeah i guess i guess it was a Saturday night and i went to see the movie The Doors a couple of days ago and they had this scene,I haven't gone to see a movie in over a year.,1
yeah i've always threatened to take lessons but i've never gotten around to it,I have been taking lessons for about fifteen years. ,1
that's hilarious to to get that jack off that's right oh that's a funny story,I will enjoy telling that story.,0
the only thing that they had a great abundance of was uh you know human beings,The only thing they had that was plentiful was people.,2
i wish it was as good over here as it is over there but if you're the,I wish it was as nice in America as it was in Iraq.,0
well and i i noticed since we moved down here to Texas my husband is originally from Texas but uh i'm not and that you don't have to have uh such a wide variety of seasonal clothes that you do up north where you have to,"My husband is originally from Texas, and is used to not having a wide variety of seasonal clothes.",2
well so okay you need to get married and have kids and then when they're big enough you can have them go do the yard  and you can do what you want to do,When your kids grow up you have have them do the yardwork.,2
and then you can add cocoa powder to it to make chocolate or after it's thickened i cook it for a good once it starts boiling i just i cook it for a good seven minutes,I never bring it to a boil when I make cocoa.,1
they take the football serious,Football is important to them.,2
um pardon me,Excuse me.,2
what does um is Robby Robin Williams does he have a funny part in the movie or is,Is Robin Williams in the movie?,0
oh yeah well i play softball a couple of times a year it's they're getting ready to start up the the season again,They play softball all times of the year,1
uh-huh you can't do that in a skirt  poor thing,You need to wear something else.,2
um-hum you mean when the reporter sticks the the microphone in the person says the face and says how do you feel that you house has burned to the ground,"Nah, everyone reporter I've known has always treated victims with respect.",1
i understand i can imagine you all have much trouble up there with insects or,"well, at least you don't have any insects there",1
yeah right right yeah i know i uh i remember my college days  and having to do that too,Back when I was in college I had that as well.,2
for the direct sunlight and stuff right but uh but i i haven't really found it too bad we've lived in our house about uh oh thirteen years i suppose and and really really only painted once and you know it was new when we bought it and we painted one time since then but you know it's probably going to be time to paint again in a couple of years,"I only had to paint the house once, so the siding has held up well.",0
i'm on i'm in the Plano school system and living in Richardson and there is a real dichotomy in terms of educational and economic background of the kids that are going to be attending this school,There is a huge amount of poor students and very few wealthy.,0
and uh you know it's like they they consider that but it would be the same way here you know it's like if if you had to do it you know you have a big sign i'm sorry i don't get paid you know,I don't receive payment because it's the same way here.,2
actually i think abortion's going to take a turn where there's not going to be as many because i think contraceptives are going to be more popular i mean i realize that they are popular now but i think,Contraceptives are becoming more popular because the prices are falling.,0
i think that's great there's a few places in Houston where they're trying that out i don't know if it's the if they've done it citywide yet or not where they have the color coded uh bags and uh bins,There are a couple places in Houston where it's being tried.,2
and he's an engineer so he even came over and set it up for me and had it running for like two hundred dollars so i thought that,"After he set it up, i took him out to lunch for being so nice.",0
um-hum um-hum yeah well uh i can see you know it's it's it's it's kind of funny because we it seems like we loan money you know we money with strings attached and if the government changes and the country that we loan the money to um i can see why the might have a different attitude towards paying it back it's a lot us that  you know we don't really loan money to to countries we loan money to governments and it's the,We loan a lot of money with strings attached and I feel bad about it.,0
because like Tech is known to be a good engineering school and A and M maybe is known more for computers,"Tech has a good reputation for engineering, while A am M is better for computer science than engineering.",2
you know it's easy to say well yeah let's let's put these old folks in a home but when i think i don't want to do that you know i don't want to be have my little home i always threaten my daughters i say well,I already have a nursing home picked out for my mother-in-law. ,0
i'm not exactly sure,I'm not exactly sure if you're aware of your issues.,0
and you know if i know that they're gonna be there you know you you i try to really watch it and like you say you know really dress up and if i know they're not you know i i've been doing a lot of reorganization you know the last couple of months the same way you are you know and it's just so it's just impossible to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress you know it is so,I spend a lot of time trying to watch it.,0
they might be but not at not at the human factors level,They're not at the human factors level. ,2
i tell you what i would not i would not buy a car that had the seat belt where it was hooked under the door,I don't want a car with the seat belt under the door.,2
actually i think abortion's going to take a turn where there's not going to be as many because i think contraceptives are going to be more popular i mean i realize that they are popular now but i think,I believe that the rising popularity of contraceptives will push the abortion rate down.,2
yeah well losing is i mean i'm i'm originally from Saint Louis and Saint Louis Cardinals when they were there were uh a mostly a losing team but,The losing streak for the Cardinals have jumped this season.,0
would you barbecue a turkey or a chicken or,"Would you cook a turkey or chicken in a barbecue? I would, they taste great that way.",0
well we bought this with credit too  well we found it with a clearance uh down in Memphis i guess and uh,We bought a clearance item in Memphis on credit.,2
i'd say they appraised it it's gone up you now maybe like five percent,It has gone down about twelve percent. ,1
i think there would be an awful lot of resentment and um i i really don't think it would be feasible on our country,The war would lead to a bunch of resentment among civilians. ,0
oh you know i like what i'm doing right now,I find my current job enjoyable.,2
uh-huh well maybe well i've enjoyed talking to you okay bye-bye,I liked talking to you.,2
are uh very few and then the other people just plan it you know it's like it's like have you have have you ever seen the commercial like for Federal Express where the with uh the think tank,Federal Express has a commercial with a think tank.,2
uh-huh and is it true i mean is it um,It's true.,2
i think it's real good anyway it's it's been it was nice meeting you,I don't wanna see you again,1
okay and and i think we just hang up i don't think we have to do anything else,We need to wait until they tell us what to do. ,1
it doesn't have to do i mean the thing is is that you know it's like you might be standing somewhere right and like let's say you're you you go you know you're driving out and you're driving back home and it's late at night and you stop by one of these you know twenty four hour you know gas stations joints,A lot of drivers stop at 24 hour gas stations.,0
there's certain times of the year of course that uh that it probably wouldn't do very well because of the temperature and stuff but but uh the right time of year it works pretty good,It works pretty good at the right time of year.,2
um something that i i think that i've noticed that i i have a friend i think if you're going into like uh law or medicine a very particular very specific field even even engineering you can get you can meet a lot of the requirements at a public um institution,"Law,medicine or engineering students get better jobs.",0
much with whatever it's with the Black the Black problem or whatever that may be now,The Black issue arose hundreds of years ago.,0
so it's it's changing and the summers are getting hot and the winters are cold but i guess i can live with it,The summers are cold and the winters are warm.,1
it's so bad wanted to mow today i was off and i wanted to mow the yard but just walking across it it's still so mushy if i took a mower out there i'd tear the sod up so bad,The best time to mow the lawn is when it's wet and mushy. ,1
yeah what do you do,What don't you do?,1
uh-huh how about any matching programs,Why is there no matching program? ,0
get something from from the Guess Who or,"Get something from the Guess Who,",2
yeah that's where i got to too the first i got chills up and down when i heard the on the radio and the first time they started doing the bombing,The bombing in Korea was shocking to the world.,0
yeah i know the motor oil,I know nothing about the motor oil.,1
right that's that's supposedly,It is always possible.  ,0
yeah i think they get bogged down in a lot of small issues that people you know special interest groups can blow up,They have approximately 300 small issues to go through.,0
yeah uh-huh but we look at it sort of as an investment in the future too,We also see it as a future investment.,2
i always wait for the movie i don't have time to read the book,I don't have time to read the book so I always wait for the film.,2
but i think let's see the teams that were there last year were see somebody from California i don't even know who won the pennant last year,I am in the dark as to who won the pennant last year,2
God i'm envious,I'm envious because it should be mine.,0
yeah well Rochester's like right on the shores isn't it,Rochester is far from the water.,1
i don't know um do you do a lot of camping,I enjoy camping.,0
yeah uh-huh oh yeah petting zoos and things,"Yes, petting and other things.",2
so i guess my experience is is just with what we did and and so they didn't really go through the child care route they were able to be home together,They weren't able to be home with their child and ended up getting childcare instead.,1
we were lucky in that in one respect in that after she had her stroke she wasn't really you know really much aware of what was going on,She still had complete awareness after her stroke.,1
what was the problem,Was the problem easy to fix?,0
you don't think it's a deterrent,You are convinced it will be a deterrent,1
oh that might be kind of interesting is it,That doesn't at all sound like something I would enjoy.,1
guess it didn't last too long at the box office but i thought it was pretty good,"I guess it wasn't in the box office for a long period of time due to poor sales, but I still thought it was great.",0
oh wow no i just started about well five years ago i think,It had started five years ago.,2
isn't it i can remember i've only been here eight years but i can remember coming to work from i used to live in Wylie and i could see downtown Dallas,Downtown Dallas was a short drive from where I lived in Wylie.,2
but uh these guys were actually on the road uh two thousand miles from from home when they had to file their uh their final exams and send them in,These men were driving in a blue Cadillac when they filed their final exams.,0
did you use a textured paint or,Did you use red bricks?,1
for one twelve dollar check,Just a check for twelve bucks.  ,2
i agree with you but did you see the map they drew up on uh on how they were gonna divide up the districts,They drew a map on how they were gonna divide up the districts.,2
yeah most mine generally stay in the windows they're they're,mine are in the windows unless i take them out to clean them,0
hey it's reaching all over,It is concentrated and limited to a small space.,1
and if it's above six hundred you're going to have to do it and i got one thirty one,"If it's is over six hundred you are required to do it, but I got one thirty one. ",2
and i and i may have been the only one that did both because the mentality in Dallas was that you couldn't like both you had to like one and hate the other,"In Dallas, the mentality is that you have to like both of them.",1
i tell you what i would not i would not buy a car that had the seat belt where it was hooked under the door,I used to own a car with the seat belts there.,0
sometimes well there's definitely a lot more hitting,The man says that he's not sure if there's more hitting.,1
and i don't think they've repainted since,I don't think they've repainted their house.,0
all right thanks bye bye,thanks for helping me with work,0
yeah i'm i'm sort of an acting process engineer but not officially but that's pretty much what i do yeah,I'm sort of an acting process scientists but officially I handle the mail for the week.,0
yep because it's when it's self propelled it's heavy yeah,"it's heavy when it's self propelled, in case you were wondering",2
course the head bangers i stay away from those entirely,I purposefully seek out head bangers as much as I can.,1
yeah that that i i had a i had a program due and uh one one window i had the program and the other one i had the program running so if there was ever a mistake i could easily check you know i could look at the program and say this is where i made the error,Because of the way it worked it was simple for me to keep track of my mistakes.,2
ooh that does get high yeah i mean,"That does increase, yeah.",2
yes well yeah i am um actually actually i think that i at the higher level education i don't think there's so much of a problem there it's pretty much funded well there are small colleges that i'm sure are struggling,Small colleges never have any troubles or challenges.,1
uh-huh well it's good that she does that i mean bring it to people's attention,It is good that she brings it to people's attention.  ,2
and uh i know what nothing is when i moved out there,That was a desolate place.,2
well i think of uh you mean as far as retirement,I think you are retiring soon.,0
and you back in you know and or just pull into your spot and uh some you can rent by the year some you can rent daily or nightly or by the week or whatever,"Some of them can be rented weekly, for example, this one's $300 per week.",0
little too much maybe,It's just the right amount.,1
so you um-hum so you think it comes down to education or or something like that,You think it comes down to education?,2
yeah yeah you know we're kind of that way too i try to i'm the same way you are i kind of try to judge from day to day i know you know where i am we work a lot with the customers and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time and,Most of our customers are female for some reason.,0
you know they they like what they're doing they you know they feel good about what they're doing that type of thing it's more,You can see the way that their whole demeanor has changed.,0
life in prison then he's available for parole if it's if it's life and a day then he's not eligible for parole so what you know let's quit BSing with the system,He'll be sentenced in two months from now.,0
because otherwise it's too it gets if you start them when it's cooler in the spring then it gets too hot in the summer,You should start them around June in order for them to not get too hot.,0
yep same here,That never happened to me.,1
yeah i've i wish they'd split that bowling season up into uh three seasons,Bowling season would be better split into thirds.,2
um-hum yeah when when i mentioned i've done this camping out of the car i've actually done of the situation just like that but what's interesting is it's through Texas Instruments,"I only camp out of a trailer, never a car.",1
and and so you know like every other day or or so they have like movies for a dollar Sometimes they're even free i think uh they showed uh Chima Para Diso free,Tickets to see Chima Para Diso cost money.,1
well i think that's about all my pet stories right now so,I have more to share about my animals.,1
or yeah exactly and that's what i say you'll you'll be you'll be so much better off for it as you get older because you know a lot of kids resent things that parents tell them and and stuff but it's because you've been there,Children are immediately obedient to parental information their entire lives.,1
just look what we did to Iraq,Iraq was something that shouldn't have happened,0
well i meant when when you were when you were growing up i mean like Galveston,You grew up in Galveston and I grew up in Dallas.,0
so i'll probably say you know it's like well we've been talking for five six minutes so okay,We started talking 5 or 6 minutes ago.,2
yeah well i can't i'll you know i say i can't wait for my kids to grow up but i believe i'm going to miss this age when they're gone,I never had any children with my wife.,1
yeah well the jury that originally sentenced him sentenced him to death,The jury acquitted him on those charges.,1
i think it's ninety two,The radio station is probably on ninety two.,0
it sure will well good to talk to,"That's true, and it was nice chatting.",2
we were lucky in that in one respect in that after she had her stroke she wasn't really you know really much aware of what was going on,She wasn't aware what was going on after her stroke.,2
oh uh-huh well no they wouldn't would they no,"No, they would like to do that.",1
from grocery store baggers that want to buy my car because it's a Trans Am they're high school seniors seventeen years old and they got to impress their girl friend,I wouldn't sell my Trans Am even if I was offered a million dollars.,0
no i i even i enjoy reading T News i try to catch it because it's another example they just they just show you the words and the facts and they they don't offer any commentary and it gives me a quick chance to to be caught up during the day because you know we don't listen to the radio at work at all so i don't like to go the whole day without hearing anything,We are bombarded with the news all day that when I get home I need to turn it off.,1
see too much crime on TV and they think it's way to go i don't know what do you think,They don't see crime on TV.,1
i don't know what kind of a summer we're expecting this year i imagine it's going to be hot again,I guess this summer will be another warm one; we'll see.,2
are uh very few and then the other people just plan it you know it's like it's like have you have have you ever seen the commercial like for Federal Express where the with uh the think tank,Some people plan things like that think tank commercial.,2
and they just put instructors out there and you you sign up for instruction and they just give you an arm band and if you see an instructor who's not doing anything you just tap him on the shoulder and ask him questions and they'll show you things,"The instructors are really good at helping, and are always available. ",0
no never heard of it,He has definitely heard of it.,1
that's cool kind of like Pink Floyd or something uh yeah basketball's cool but football kind of after a while,"Yeah, I love basketball and football.",0
uh well no i just know i know several single mothers who absolutely can't afford it they have to go with the a single uh what i mean a babysitter more more or less,I know single moms who wouldn't be able to afford it.,2
so well i think we've taken up at least five minutes,I've taken up too much of the last bit of time so you should go.,0
it would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good,I think it would be a lot more work to do it like that instead of my way,0
yeah they uh they the voters voted one way and it and then uh some federal judge said no that was unconstitutional and they have had two or three votes and the city council is divided over what the district should be because they divide it one way and the minorities say we're losing representation  representation and uh it it's just a big battle,the vote of the people was actually unconstitutional,2
i spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst,Being an intelligence analyst is hard work.,0
but you know they kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that and and they don't follow it at all you know there're very few scouts go on and become Eagle Scouts and and i don't know what the high rank is for the gals but,All Boy Scouts go on to be Eagle Scouts.,1
i know because i think i've been reading i read this ten years ago that they were having these big uh um rallies and people would be in the streets flashing signs statehood yes and other people would statehood down the statehood it's it down there if you're um familiar with their politics they uh it's very uh i i don't know it's called Latino there they have loudspeakers on their cars and they run down the neighborhood saying vote for you know Pierre he's or uh Pedro uh Pedro he's the best it's it's really kind of comical,I'm not really familiar with the politics there.,1
the only thing that they had a great abundance of was uh you know human beings,They had a large amount of resources such as fruit and wheat.,1
that's uh only way to do it,It's a good way to get it done.,0
well and i i noticed since we moved down here to Texas my husband is originally from Texas but uh i'm not and that you don't have to have uh such a wide variety of seasonal clothes that you do up north where you have to,"I've noticed that since I've moved down to Texas, one doesn't need to have a wide variety of seasonal clothes. ",2
someone else noticed it and i said well i guess that's true and it was somewhat melodio us in other words it wasn't just you know it was really funny,No one noticed and it wasn't funny at all. ,1
no that's true and and and Lord knows with that legislature up there they probably did all kinds of things while he wasn't looking,The Legislature must be watched.,0
trying to keep grass alive during a summer on a piece of ground that big was expensive,There was no cost in keeping the grass alive in the summer time.,1
yeah the the i mean people like that are crazy i did a study on it though when i was in high school it was one of these things we had to pick a topic to to investigate and at that time i don't think it's like that any more but at that time uh it was very unfair capital punishment was a lot more  common and if you tended and it tended to be that if you were ignorant or if you were a foreigner or if you were black or any minority for that matter the chances your chances of of uh getting the death penalty were you know like hundreds of times greater than if you could just communicate well i mean you didn't have to be um you didn't even necessarily have to be white but if you could just communicate and you could come across in the court room with some kind of um,"It was something very dark and secretive, only containable in a wall of text.",1
i know that i didn't much uh-huh oh,I did it a lot.,1
i can't do any jumping up and down because it makes it hurt,There is no pain from jumping.,1
and then i got into it and then back out of it and it it just seems like every couple of years i get back in there,I plan to get into it on a regular basis.,0
you know they can't really defend themselves like somebody grown uh say my age you know yeah,They can't defend themselves because of their age.,2
and i'll go there for you know two months straight we won't go anyplace else,I won't go there ever again.,1
yep see we have cable here,"Yes, we have cable here.",2
it was difficult,It was easy.,1
uh yeah they were uh they were very good i was impressed,"They showed a lot of skill juggling those kittens, only dropping one.",0
he's not a starter,He always plays in the middle or towards the end.,0
yes uh i bought a uh Bristol thirty five five for my wife,"My wife absolutely has a Bristol 355, just not from me. ",1
are you originally from uh Texas,You're originally from Texas?,2
apparently apparently the appraisers likes it because our taxes sure is high  isn't it it really is,The appraisers liked the item because our taxes are high.,2
i don't know i i do i can think of all the uh the biblical things about it too where what did they say to uh i can't think of the scripture Render unto Caesar's what is Caesar's so,I know there are things related to religion and the bible.,2
yeah you can also do the same thing using um if you have ground beef just stir fry the ground beef drain off the oil use the same hoi sin sauce and um some of the frozen mixed vegetables,"So you can fry ground beef, drain it, and then add hoi sin sauce and vegetables.",2
um-hum  right do where are you at what state,How many miles did you run?,1
excessively violent i was worried it's like golly if kids start imitating that,I hope that the children will not mimic this type of extreme violence.,2
and my and my part-time work you know it's not our the restaurant our favorite restaurant in the town of Salisbury where actually we live you know where my where i'll return to my job or whatever we can normally eat out for um under fourteen dollars,"We hated the restaurant in Salisbury, it was really expensive to eat at.",1
in Asia yeah i spent,I've never been to Asia,1
uh my uh roommate took a voice over course,The roommate was receiving instructions. ,0
um i know that i had heard that uh McDonald's has gotten so much flack about sending their hot foods out in the Styrofoam that they are going to work on something,Styrofoam is not a safe thing to have near food.,0
oh well yeah that's all i have to say thank you,"Thank you, that's all I have to say.",2
and i look back on that and i bought shoes i went shopping i did not need that money i did not need it i didn't need it i shouldn't have even qualified to get it i didn't need it and it would have been a little rough i might have eaten some bologna instead of roast beef out of the deli but i did not need it and as i look back now now we're paying that back i told my son if you have to live in the ghetto to go to college do it but don't take out ten thousand dollars in loans don't do it and i don't i hope don't think he'll have to do that but i just so like we might if we didn't have those loans we could have saved in the last five years the money for that and i believe we would have because God's really put it in our heart not to get in debt you know but we have friends at church that do this on a constant basis that are totally debt free and they pay cash for everything they buy,My friends should look towards me as a model of saving money.,0
i mean that's a real attractive option if you have the the technology for it all it was was you know i mean she just used a phone modem and she was like she was sitting in the office,She used a phone modem but it was very different than if she were in the office. ,1
so i guess my experience is is just with what we did and and so they didn't really go through the child care route they were able to be home together,It was a good thing that they didn't go the child care route as they were able to be home with their child more often.,0
well it's a pleasure talking with you,I'm glad we've talked. ,2
did you well it's not just that are there enough jobs for people here now,it's not only that people can find jobs here more easily now,2
the hologram makes up all these things and uh i mean sometimes  sometimes it's funny sometimes it's not but uh you know it's something to pass the time until we do and then and then we watch football,We do other activities together before the football game starts.,2
yeah that that i i had a i had a program due and uh one one window i had the program and the other one i had the program running so if there was ever a mistake i could easily check you know i could look at the program and say this is where i made the error,I could only view one window at a time so it was very hard to catch any errors.,1
it sure will well good to talk to,That is unlikely and this conversation has gotten us nowhere.,1
uh-huh you can't do that in a skirt  poor thing,You cannot do that wearing a skirt.,2
is there still that type of music available,I would love to listen to more of it.,0
oh it's fun i call,"I call, oh, it is fun.",2
i am surprised though that we do have so many that are in politics down here,I am surprised that not many of them are in politics down here.,1
i cried when the horse got killed and when the wolf got killed,Animal killings make me want to cry.,0
made it yeah made it all the way through four years of college playing ball but,I played basketball in college.,2
right right well you know i think uh i think it's going to happen i don't know i don't know what else i could suggest to them you know if they ask me what should we do i don't know i wouldn't know what else to suggest to them just education start with these little kids you know and like you said you know start making it practice you know start showing all the street signs and all the cars of course i think all the cars are manufactured that way they aren't aren't all of them most o f the new ones i'm seeing are are made with miles per hour and kilometers on them,Education will make it happen.,0
and i need to be better because uh uh we just bought it my wife and i just bought a new car and uh you know we want to take real good care of it so uh,We paid a good amount for it.,0
oh that sounds interesting too,That sounds fascinating as well.,2
and it's just like college too i think that if a kid goes to college and you can help them fine but i don't think you should pay the whole way,You should pay the whole way for the kid's college tuition.,1
oh i don't know either the other growing up all i knew was,When I was 7 the only thing I knew was,0
you sound like this girl that i talked to about books and we got into movies one night,You remind me of talking to a girl about books and movies.,2
or yeah exactly and that's what i say you'll you'll be you'll be so much better off for it as you get older because you know a lot of kids resent things that parents tell them and and stuff but it's because you've been there,Kids don't like what their parents have told them. ,2
yes they would they just wouldn't be able to own the kind of automobiles that they think they deserve to own or the kind of homes that we think we deserve to own we might have to you know just be able to i think if we a generation went without debt then the next generation like if if our our generation my husband and i we're twenty eight if we lived our lives and didn't become you know indebted like you know our generation before us that um the budget would balance and that we became accustomed to living with what we could afford which we wouldn't be destitute i mean we wouldn't be living on the street by any means but just compared to how spoiled we are we would be in our own minds but i feel like the generation after us would oh man it it would be so good it would be so much better it wouldn't be perfect but then they could learn to live with what what they could afford to save to buy and if you want a nicer car than that well you save a little longer,I am glad our generation has no debt.,1
so that's that's one of your priorities there's got to be air has to be an automatic,Do not get a car if it has a broken air-conditioning system.,0
and uh the whole organization was targeting to replace whole life policies with a term life with annuity an annuity and uh,Whole life policies with a term life with annuity could be replaced by the whole organization.,2
yeah so it's easy to do i'm actually interested in getting one of those kind of my wife has been talking about this in the past couple of years one of those kind of campers that pop-up so it's about uh maybe eight foot square and but only about two feet tall and when you get to where you're going it raises up and there's tenting material,I don't want a camper like that.,1
because i always had to do it and so i just pay someone else to do it and they do the they do the cutting they fertilize they um edge and um i think this year i'm going to have some landscaping put in,I still do all the gardening and landscaping myself. ,1
oh no no they're not fired they there are they have one chance to then go in a program if you come back positive you have one chance to go in and go into they have a lot of uh rehabilitation both for alcohol and for drug use uh and they have uh a lot of uh they they have an agency where you can go for personal problems financial or whatever,There has been several people who had to go for rehabilitation last year.,0
sort of a building season season yeah,The time for major construction projects.,0
yeah that that i i had a i had a program due and uh one one window i had the program and the other one i had the program running so if there was ever a mistake i could easily check you know i could look at the program and say this is where i made the error,"Doing it this way took longer, but it was worth it.",0
yep and then i had probably lived the last eleven years in Massachusetts so you know what does that make me an honorary Yankee or,I've lived the last 11 years in Massachusetts so I'm basically and honorary Yankee.,2
now you know the ball'll go straight and i go  i never broke a club or anything but you know i'd get upset about it sometimes and now i guess you know being in my forties i just kind of mellowed out a little bit i don't get upset any more so,Age has made me more calm when I play sports.,2
and those are the people that you know can you rehabilitate them the some of the ones that are you know perpetual,"If people repeatedly commit the same crimes, why bother letting them out?",0
you know your children are going you know you've got five children in school instead of somebody that only has one or none and so you they're paying more income tax to pay for your children to go to school it just you know doesn't make sense,The income tax laws need to be changed to make them fair.,0
plus i like to dance you know,"I hate dancing, you know.",1
yes yeah yeah well it it that's right and it,that isn't correct,1
were sort of a double sign with a a big miles per hour and a little kilometers per hour type uh marking on the side,A sign displaying both mph and kph.,2
i don't even know how they figure it really i'm glad i don't work in a store,I'm glad I don't work in a department store.,0
an d now we got the governor she's going to do that,"Now we have the governor, there is no way she is going to do it.",1
there and they uh they in fact they had this was in uh the late twenties and they in fact used some of the equipment that had been left over and uh he turned them down it it's interesting that that most people don't realize how small the canal is have you ever been there,This was in 1928,0
other side that's a good idea,Only after we finish the first side.,0
isn't it i can remember i've only been here eight years but i can remember coming to work from i used to live in Wylie and i could see downtown Dallas,I could see downtown Dallas from where I lived in Wylie.,2
do you think most states have that or,"In your opinion, do most states have that?",2
so i like music i like listening to music so i don't usually listen to KCBI and then there's another one called Journey that's somewhere in between the two of those it's in between ninety and ninety four,"KCBI does not play music, so I don't listen to it.",1
that your approach is is is right you can actually go out and sub it if even if you don't wanna get hands on you can even just sub it out the concrete and those kind of things and and that's kind of the plan i have so um uh everyone i talk to uh i've,You can not ever sub it.,1
but it but again it depends on what job you're in the men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot,The men who fix the power lines are never tested.,1
huh no i haven't attempted that i'm satisfied with what we have right now and we do have a gas credit card and we use that,I don't care for what we have right now.,1
is that what you ended up going into,So that's what you could've done if things had been different?,1
Detroit Pistons they're not as good as they were last year,"The Detroit Pistons are not as good as they were last year, most of their good players left",0
yeah well i i started uh studying mathematics basically because i was really good at that in high school,My worst subject in high-school was mathematics.,1
but i've lived up here all my life and i'm fifty eight years old so i i could,I have moved somewhere else in my life.,1
of course you got to charge it and keep your cash,You have to keep your cash and charge it.,2
i guess it's just you know and when i think about that lady this this particular lady who wrote me a check for twelve dollars and it bounced and i sent it through you know sent it through the check through the bank once and she incurred at least a fifteen dollar fee,A lady wrote me a check for 12 dollars and it went through with no issue.,1
oh i believe that uh mine would say the same uh but uh i seem too rely on them too much,That's believable and mine wouldn't say differently. ,2
oh it's fun i call,I like calling my friends for fun.,0
no it didn't,It didn't make it over the jump.,0
so that's that's one of your priorities there's got to be air has to be an automatic,Air conditioning should not be an important factor.,1
down here it's been it's everybody's got colds and everything because it's cold one day and hot the next day,The colds are directly related to the temperature change.  ,2
well it's a pleasure talking with you,It's been terrible speaking with you. ,1
oh that might be kind of interesting is it,That sounds kinda interesting to me.,2
cook and then the next time it would be my turn and i'd try to outdo him and then he'd try to outdo me and  we we was really a lot of fun and,I would cook and then the next turn would be his and we would try to outdo each other but sometimes we would get in a fight over things.,1
you can get a hard copy of it and that's about it,You have several choices besides a hard copy.,1
okay i guess we're on,I think I'll have to cancel.,1
but you're without a paycheck during that time and i don't at least that's my understanding is even you know the first time you go for counseling and it's six weeks before you're back to work,I don't think you lose any money if you got to counciling.,1
and clean up is is uh is a joy uh a little soap and water and air dry them and you don't have to worry about that,You let it air dry because it'll smudge any other way.,0
hi Mary have you gone visiting uh any new restaurants lately,"Hi Mary, thanks for going to the restaurant with me yesterday, it was fun.",1
well the parts to to me i spent twenty two dollars on the parts,"I spent 22 dollars on the parts, I think i got swindled.",0
oh older ones too i know a few of those,I don't know any of the older ones.,1
down here it's been it's everybody's got colds and everything because it's cold one day and hot the next day,The temperatures are going up and down every day.  ,2
you know some of the really the really emotional ones have you followed the Dallas elections on zoning,I'm very interested in how the Dallas elections turn out since I'm hoping to develop some land.,0
it was really a nice compromise especially because she felt like she was still living in her own house and she still had her own couch and her own bed and it it really helped a lot and she was a lot more comfortable and she didn't,Having her own furniture in the house made it much more comfortable for her. Yet still able get assistance if she needed it.They check on them two or three times a day and give their medication also.,0
okay and and i think we just hang up i don't think we have to do anything else,"We don't have to do anything else but put the phone down, I think. ",2
so i have to find a way to supplement that,That should be enough by itself.,1
oh i'll bet they did,I'm sure they didn't.,1
uh i really i miss college i had a good time,I would like to go back to university. ,0
um-hum yeah right uh is yours a is it a a slab foundation or pier and beam,Your foundation is fine.,0
well that would be a help i wish they would do that here we have got so little landfill space left that we're going to run out before the end of this decade and it's really going to be,We're going to run out of land space soon.,2
they might be but not at not at the human factors level,Are they hiring?,0
yeah yeah uh-huh yeah we we saw that one uh we find that uh that uh if you can get into those dollar movies you know they're uh they're a dollar and a half what is it dollar and a quarter dollar and a half now,You can get Flubber at the dollar movies.,0
so i have to find a way to supplement that,I should have a couple different types of supplementation to cover all my bases.,0
no i mean there there there was nothing to it i mean,It was no big deal.,2
maybe adult literacy maybe you know composition writing maybe you know uh volunteering you know on a tutor line or though the even through the elementary schools for help with homework or the other part of me says is God i've had enough kids  do i really,maybe I could volunteer to help coach sports since I've helped all my children be successful in sports,1
yep because it's when it's self propelled it's heavy yeah,it's very light when it's self propelled,1
how do you like it well,What are your feelings?,2
i i have some feelings about it in the sense that i feel if a person is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and it's a really heinous crime i feel like the Bible says an eye for an eye,I'm sure that it's never justified no matter how bad the crime.,1
yeah because being a student i'm doing it for the money,This project pays better than most other student jobs.,0
you know getting clothes and stuff every once in awhile exactly,They get socks more often than shirts.,0
yeah right uh-huh that's right yeah you you have to work on you really do,Yeah you have to work on that.,2
yeah and crawl through it,I understand that I have to crawl through,2

oh does it sure,"oh, does it really cost that much? sure it does",0
it was really a nice compromise especially because she felt like she was still living in her own house and she still had her own couch and her own bed and it it really helped a lot and she was a lot more comfortable and she didn't,"It really works out well, she had all her own furniture and stuff, so she felt like it was her own home.

yeah well that's my uh i mean every time i've tried to go you know it's always there's there's always a league bowling,"I go and bowl all the time, there are never leagues in the way.",1
because uh i know people who eat tons of that kind of stuff and they're just as healthy as can be,"People who eat unhealthy foods are not sick are lucky, so far.",0

yes they would they just wouldn't be able to own the kind of automobiles that they think they deserve to own or the kind of homes that we think we deserve to own we might have to you know just be able to i think if we a generation went without debt then the next generation like if if our our generation my husband and i we're twenty eight if we lived our lives and didn't become you know indebted like you know our generation before us that um the budget would balance and that we became accustomed to living with what we could afford which we wouldn't be destitute i mean we wouldn't be living on the street by any means but just compared to how spoiled we are we would be in our own minds but i feel like the generation after us would oh man it it would be so good it would be so much better it wouldn't be perfect but then they could learn to live with what what they could afford to save to buy and if you want a nicer car than that well you save a little longer,Life will be great for subsequent generations if our generation goes without debt.,0
