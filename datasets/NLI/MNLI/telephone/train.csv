uh on the scale they gave one to ten i'd say i'm probably a four i'm not totally i'm not one of these people that believes that we should not be able to buy guns but i don't think we should be carrying Uzis either  you know what i mean  yeah i know i mean i don't think machine guns automatic weapons i don't believe in things like that but i think,I'm about a four out of ten on the scale.,2
and once they do that then people will be more interested right now it doesn't matter how much garbage you put out to the road it's a flat fee a month,People might be more interested if there was a reduced fee for putting out more garbage. ,0
uh but i did like to walk and my neighbor and i get out we'd walk and walk and uh unfortunately we haven't done it well i've been in class until it's like seven thirty at night and she having is having a flare up of arthritis and we haven't done it for in about a month,I liked to walk and so did my neighbor.,2

uh several years ago my very best friend moved to back to Grand Island Nebraska and we had ridden bicycles and it was bothering my knees that spring and we have lots of wind in Indiana and i thought oh shoot i'll just walk to town and i guess that probably started me on a career because i walk a lot in fact it's a part of my life every day i walk at least two miles uh as a side effect i noticed that i was firming up so i thought well gosh maybe if i diet you know this might be work out real well so i ended up losing about thirty five pounds that spring and summer and i had not thought of myself as a fat person and people would say to me gosh i didn't you know,My best friend moved to Nebraska.,2
so the you know just for the doesn't really work out for us too economical to pay twenty dollars for a one way bus ride for these two kids but some days we have to do it some days it just works out to where i don't get into work early enough to get off,It's so cheap to use the bus!,1
you know on the schedule but then it seems like it might be longer than a week,It seems like it might take more than seven days.,2
no should i rent it should i go rent it tomorrow,I ought to rent it tomorrow.,2
it kind of kept you guessing on on uh what was going to happen next,That show likes to keep you guessing.,0

well i i don't know there was well whatever it was there was a second there i couldn't even hear what you were saying but um,"There was nothing happening, and I could hear you clearly the entire time.",1
uh it just makes absolutely makes perfectly good sense to me because it's all decimal,"It's logical to me, because it uses decimals.",2
the the diaper service trucks apparently the fuel that they use and the fumes that they produce to deliver and drop those off,The diaper service trucks omit no fumes. ,1
child rearing or child day care,Raising a kid or providing daily care for a kid.,2

i mean yeah and i mean certainly he wasn't going to take Bob Dole on and not that Bob Dole would even take the position i mean he'd be giving up more than he'd gain,Bob Dole is a menace to society.,0
that's right exactly right i mean,That is correct.,2
so you're still able to walk yeah well is there anything else about exercise we can talk about,"Despite previous events, you still have the ability to walk.",0
late fifties yeah i think i saw that one,In the late seventies I didn't see that one. ,1
and uh course there too you never know what the weather's going to be when you start getting over to,"It might rain, it might clear up, it might snow.",0
major things it won't cover cosmetic type things you know if you choose to do something but um it's just like all in it's just all in practice it's all in plan i think that we could learn from that,I read in the fine print that it won't cover superficial things.,0
well i did too about a month ago i had a a real severe cold but nothing that required you know um a doctor's visit or anything like that i was just able to take some aspirin and rest for a couple of days but it just seemed like it,I would've gone to the doctor's if a few days of rest and aspirin didn't help.,0

you know you the lid pops off the little tent comes up the top and it had two double beds in it,The tent is large enough for a few people.,0
well that's what my impression was that they you know that they were just white well they're white walls you know unless it's white if you want white walls then white plaster is uh doesn't need to be painted or that was my impression anyway i'm not sure,My impression was that they were just white but they're not.,2
oh but i still feel good the minute i put that paint on even if it has got a dent in it i do,"I still appreciate painting, even when there is a dent.",2
and they're real happy with one another and she says things like  i'm really glad when he comes home and there's not enough time to spend with him in the evening and  i'm like,Girls Scouts prevent people from getting divorced. ,1

have you been uh struggling along those lines,You need to adjust your perspective.,0
and compared to the humidity here you know in fact uh whenever i think about moving you know whenever we talk maybe about moving back to the east coast the thing that comes back to me is that sensation of those stifling summers which which i don't experience here,I think about moving almost every day.,0
it it is it is very hard to go back and and actually the academic part isn't bad when your when you resume because it seems that things come easier because you're more mature and you've got all your life experiences and i thought the academic part would be harder but it really isn't uh because uh it because uh uh i don't know i think the maturity factor uh uh overcomes the fact that you've had a gap,I thought the academics would be a lot harder but it isn't too bad.,2
care provider right she goes to seminars and uh she gets home visitations by this state uh uh i don't know the state boards i guess some of them and then some by the association and they,She doesn't bother to go to any of the seminars.,1
and down there at Sabine Pass uh i can't think of the guy's name but he held off the you know just he and a handful of guys managed to hold off the whole Union navy for a while from coming up the Sabine River which was of no consequence but still is an interesting story,Just a couple men managed to hold off the union Navy for quite a while.,2

well that's pretty um i've talked about camping with someone i've talked about the weather,"I've never wanted to go camping with anyone, I'm uninterested in the weather",1

um-hum well it is March after all you know you're not supposed to worry about sunburn in March,March is the sunniest month of the year.,1
and if it weren't for the tumble of the ball Buffalo would have been there this year and and to me that's another super team course,Buffalo did not make any mistakes but they will still be there this year.,1
and they finished second that year i guess and it was Bobby Lane's first it was the year that Bobby Lane got traded to them two games into the season,It was the year they got Bobby Lane after the season had started.,2
and it was right i had uh i had put one coat of of uh,I walked to the store and did a back flip.,1
and i do silly things like that versus a a regular program that you would have,"I do silly things like that, instead of the regular program.",2
which is right on on the Massachusetts Rhode Island state line that's that's why i work in Massachusetts it's only it's only a twenty minute ride,"It's only a twenty minute ride to Massachusetts, where I work.",2

beforehand,Two hours before.,0
that's my buzzer at the door,That's my door buzzer. ,2
we're still using those things,we've been using those since 2005,0
but it was interesting i had to go buy a hoe and a rake i mean the whole works because i've i've lived in an apartment for so long i've never had that kind of equipment so that was that was interesting to go down there and and get all that kind of stuff,"I had an indoor garden in my apartment, so I had to use a hoe and rake.",1
real fast,Really quick,2
it's the rest of it huh you know the uh-huh,"Uh huh, it's the rest of the dinner on the table.",0

and sure enough boy the fur just came off like crazy once i got them in the tub so,The fur came off in the water.,2
oh i thought we were going to talk about social changes is that is that what you're kind of directing it oh okay okay well  um,Can we talk about anything other than social changes?,1
um did someone just come up with this design and and you're going to make one for yourself or are you going to buy it,No one has figured the design out yet.,1

yeah yeah you would think they would,You would expect them to.,2
we were anxious to move close to family members just because we wanted our children to know their grandparents and things like that,We don't want our children to know their grandparents.,1
yeah good see that's the thing that is going to have to that's the undoing of everything is that we have no morals i mean,"We have morals, and that can hurt you. ",2
yeah he's been there for since i left,he's been there since I left.,2
but exactly,However closely.,0
read and that's about it,"read lots of books, but that's about it",0
i i i would find that too difficult,I would find that very challenging.,2
but yeah there are more drinkers than smokers if you think about it,There are more drinkers than smokers.,2
uh-huh it's almost getting to the point where there is there's too much that,It's getting to be too much news to handle.,0
so and it doesn't generate uh there's a little dust on it once in a while but it's not even like hot air,It has a coating on it to prevent any dust from settling on it.,1
than had been available before,There were resources we had access to before.,2
never been up there,I always go there.,1
true it's it's probably their their their troubles probably stem from the fact that they're such a diverse party,If they weren't such a diverse party then they wouldn't have so many troubles. ,0
you know but not him he's never happy and i think that's that's why he makes as much as he do is because he keeps thriving for more,The person says that he is always happy.,1
so in each of the dorms you have a place for that,there's no particular place for that in any of the dorms,1
oh you can really get some good really good pictures in black and white,Black and white pictures never turn out well.,1

i don't know if they don't have them up there do they,I know for sure that they have them there.,1
we can't even well we're not even really supposed to wear jeans very often so it really doesn't vary that much from season to season since the office is kind of you know always the same temperature,"we're not supposed to wear jeans often, but that varies from season to season since the office is climate-controlled",2
that's crazy but i think they're under stress i mean i can't imagine working in a nursing home like that either because it must be so depressing,I totally understand how the caregivers at nursing home can be under stress.,0
but uh yeah i i have no i don't know anybody that's that done that either so i it's it's interesting we got this topic because i i i don't know what i marked off to get this but,I marked off for us to get this topic because I know someone who has done that,1
yeah i'm trying to think what i've seen lately i mean well well we just finished watching uh Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on tape you know,I didn't watch a movie.,1
that could get you in awful lot of trouble,That will bring you much joy.,1
yeah oh that can be that that can really slow you down,It is possible to be slowed down. ,2
instead of just the guilty party pays,"I can't believe that you have to pay, even if you aren't guilty.",1
no we don't have mandatory we actually we're kind of slow up here and we've just started doing recycling probably last summer and it's all voluntary so that's interesting cities have a mandatory recycling,"We've only started recycling last summer, though it is all voluntary.",2
and is that supported by all donation to the church and so forth or,It isn't supported by all donations to the church at all.,1
so do you see a lot of uh well let's see what's in Colorado do you see a lot of immigrants of any kind like like we do here,Has Colorado been enriched by our new friends from out of the country?,1

i don't oh that's just that's just so that the uh now see they made more money down there and they got real cheap labor in Mexico,They get cheap labor in Mexico so they make money down there.  ,2
hope to talk to you again maybe,I never want to talk to you again.,1
no you don't want to do that it's got to be you know a laboratory that do quality control and and double check and i think that TI has has latched themselves up with an established group and and that would be true for any company that does it and and not to have a just a very casual thing it's got to be with a you know first class totally independent agency not local of course ours i think well i think it was in in the south somewhere but it wasn't even in Dallas you know the one that did us yeah,The agency that does ours is right next door to our company.,1
i mean that would be great,I would love to do it.,0
yeah i'd agree with that,"Yes, I would concur.",2
i know it and then some the winner the one that's voted the best wins ten thousand dollars so you know,The winner is the one that's voted the best.,0
yeah yeah but other than that i've heard the the you know the um the scenery in it is absolutely beautiful,I do not like how it looks here,1
and then they took that away as far as,"They took that away, too. ",2
well it's it's his job too and i to me the only important issue is the children because as far as housework goes you know men can do housework just as easily as women and thanks to a lot of new inventions housework doesn't take as much time as it used to so uh,Your husband works enough at his job. You should help him out by taking care of the kids and the home by yourself.,1
yeah but then there's people you talk to and say i've never been sick a day in my life you know so i guess i guess you know the the studies show as an average,I guess the study accounts for people who have never been sick.,0
yeah they uh yeah i i don't know it right around the turn of uh oh gosh i should say the eighties now now it's already the nineties i forgot i forget that too,They put out that album around the start of the eighties. ,0
no i've never i was off for about six months too just for some other surgery i'd had but i've never i'd you know i was pretty much in shape walking and and you know this is one of those things like this orthopedist said he said you'd be surprised how many basketball how many people come in here with things like that because they are active,"According to the orthopedist, basketball players often have this type of surgery.",0
yeah i definitely agree and i remember back in high school being on the debate team and that was one of the subjects one of the debates should we have you know national health care and i remember debating for it,I never had an opinion when it comes to national health care coverage.,1
yeah right when you see the ones who are successful and there are many of them around and uh makes me feel good to know i played one small part in their rearing,I like that I played a role in their rearing.,2
but what you don't forget is the growing up it's really the period when people become adults i mean people who don't go to college become adults in other ways but really it's the entry into adulthood i think and i think that the best way to choose a college is to decide what kind of environment you want to,"but what you don't forget is the growing up, people who don't go to college become adults in other ways.",1
yeah i have to stay up if i want to see it i have to stay up till eleven thirty and then it's all reruns and the guy that was started out in it isn't in it and anyway it's a long,I wake up early to see it.,1

so oh well it's been seven minutes,It has been seven minutes since the beginning of the call. ,0
well you mentioned one of my pet buzz words there which is sensitivity to it and particularly violence i uh really get uh ticked off with uh seeing this violence so much of it on TV and so forth in the movies,The violence on TV and Movies does not affect me.,1
yes vociferously,"not really, but maybe vociferously",0
yeah i don't do much with flowers myself i just get a lot of evergreen evergreen type shrubs some uh,I don't buy shrubs nor flowers,1

and i'm not sure what what to do about that or which way it's going to go,I don't really know which direction it's going to go or what to do about it.,2
it gets kind of i we used to have one of those little caves you can go back in,In the past we had a small cave you can go back in.,2
because the projector made a lot makes a lot of noise,The projector is awfully noisy.,2
so it's basically mindless i mean all your you the only really thing you are having to use is connecting the things that they give you you know what you're hearing and your your sight uh your sight but they give you everything else,They don't bother even giving you anything.,1
uh-huh well the thing about that is though it's got a i mean because it was i mean it was big you remember like in the early seventies and all that and,It's not as big now as it was in the early seventies.,0
yeah no no i don't i don't particularly get into those shows because they don't keep my interest i've seen um L A Law i think once or twice and the episode wasn't that great so i just i figured they were all like that so i don't waste my time,Shows like LA Law don't really hold my interest much.,2
and i don't know too much about the air pollution thing i do know for other types of uh pollution like the toxic waste and such that TI has to dispose of the we normally put in the ground you know we're coming up with a a new solution we have been finding a lot of toxic places to dump and we just transport to these places but after while it always seems that the um oh the site starts to leak and then you have to clean it up and such but the new idea is to take everything up to Sherman and we're gonna have that you know incineration place up there and dump everything there and supposedly that facility will not generate air pollutants,There is no pollution in the environment at all. ,1
yeah i've done that once or twice i didn't look at the clock when we started talking so i guess we should talk about football a little bit longer just to be sure we got five minutes in,i totally lost track of time so let's get our five minutes done,2

and uh well i don't i don't own a balloon but i crew for a guy he owns two balloons,I don't own a balloon and I have zero experience with them.,1
yes i know the one thing that i think is really sad about it as i recall from the articles that i've read is that if if people who have been there,I was happy reading through all the articles.,1
so i know they treat him good,i'm not sure if they treat him very poorly,1
yeah but don't don't you like to get away from it all every once in a while and go to a nice quiet restaurant sometime,Don't you prefer to go to a nice restaurant sometimes?,2
i think he'll be okay once he gets on,He will still be at risk even when he gets on.,1
yeah i know what you're saying like well we have it at work we have a very aggressive recycling at work and i'm the one who will pick the newspaper out of the trash and bring it to the recycle bin see some people the recycle bin is on their way out,"My workplace cares very little about recycling, we simply throw things in the dumpsters.",1
yeah it is it's very good i think TV has really had some bad effects on all of us,I believe TV has had some good effects on everyone. ,0
so yes it's it's it's become a big part of our lives even though we're late players,We're late players because we were occupied with other things earlier.,0
yeah Saint Louis whatever,Salt Lake City,1
oh okay because uh the ones that we use you you know are like Unix base systems and so they don't have a disk drive you know so you can't you you the only way that you can do it is through a modem,We use a something that closely resembles a Unix base system.,2
uh well it's been very interesting,It isn't very intriguing. ,1
well i graduated from college in nineteen seventy two,"I did not go to college, and was a high school dropout.",1
you know if there's a breeze blowing it's a nice comfortable day and you don't feel like you have to take ten showers a day because you you take a shower and walk outside and the humidity's so great you know you're sweating to death again,"I don't sweat when it's humid, I actually like it",1
uh-huh well that's interesting,That has my attention. ,2
okay well i used to hate Star Trek,I hated Star Trek last year.,0

uh in the Houston area,Located in or close to Houston.,2
that's right no it's not  it's it's not pocket change so it's major so but maybe when the kids get in school that will be you know when they start needing something you know then that will be different but,It is inexpensive. ,1
right you know with the chance of even getting paroled and uh you know that's just i just don't understand that,There is a chance or getting paroled.,2
right but i wonder how much longer they're going to be a them,I do not know for sure how much more time it will be.,2
well i i got a stopwatch here,Do you have a stopwatch that I can borrow?,1
um-hum um-hum uh-huh i think single parents probably contribute a lot of the problems in school systems because the system's really getting sixty percent of the student's day if if the mother or the father certainly would have to work and they're not getting home until probably five o'clock at the very earliest and the student's out at three,Single parents are no more of a burden of the school systems than married parents.,1
well we're still writing checks for the loans for Notre Dame,Did your parents or grandparents read to you when you were young?,0
yeah no no i don't i don't particularly get into those shows because they don't keep my interest i've seen um L A Law i think once or twice and the episode wasn't that great so i just i figured they were all like that so i don't waste my time,I prefer shows that are light and have lots of humor.,0
i kind of got burnt out on Steven King though it seems like,I have never read any books by Steven King.,1
well it is to a certain extent to have to try to keep up with all that,We don't keep up with that.,1
plus it would cost me oh i think the last time i looked at it was about had a dollar fifty one way and i said no i'm not going to do that fast isn't that bad yet,It cost me about a dollar fifty one way.,2
you you know i've seen a lot of people that do that,I have witnessed plenty of people doing that.,2
right but see i really think yeah i i think those characters came right off the screen in that story you know it was really enjoyable and and my wife we thought the same thing we were so pleasantly surprised,My wife and I were in agreement about the story being amazing.,0
well that's that's the that's because we're supposed to be the rich ones with all the money to give away,We don't have as much money as it seems because of taxes.,0
well i'm trying build up my tolerance now i just surgery um less than two months ago and right now i'm just a little over about a mile and a half but i try try to workup to three miles,I've been slowing working my way up to three miles since having surgery a few months ago.,2

and where do you go,I don't care where you go.,1
no i'm kind of uh actually uh i think they've got the draft choices to make to make a good run at it but i i'm not sure how well they'll draft,I don't know how well they'll draft but at least the choices are good. ,2
and so the whole page you you never can actually see it you just draw it and they have to zoom out and zoom in and you know it's like every time that you have to do something is it's really a pain,"And so, you can always actually see the whole page, just draw it and that's it.",1

they have programs on uh house repairs and how to build things and um they have a calligraphy show and i do calligraphy so i watch that,There are programs dealing with home repairs.,2
yeah to to go run up a big bill and the thing is there some  there some advantages if he got off some place and stranded i i'm i'm leaning towards doing it for for convenience,Make sure the bill stays low.,1
it's just you know judging from what everyone else wears is how i determine,I just decide based on what everyone else is wearing.,2
yeah hopefully the next generation it won't even be an issue i mean people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman i think that would be the best goal,The next generation will see you as a male or female only.,1
have you been involved on the switchboard long,Do you have extensive switchboard experience? ,0
and they say it's going to last about two to three weeks and this guy in front of me said i can't believe i was summoned i was an investigator and i was tailing the woman that was killed well then i have a friend at school that has a boyfriend that's a lawyer and he said that this woman this socialite in Plano had hired four guys to kill her husband and the one that's accused was the one that actually did it and she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been uh getting cocaine from his client and then selling it and he had skipped bail and they finally extradited him and he's going to testify for the state against her so he'll have his sentence reduced,I was an investigator following this woman that was killed.  ,2

like fabric that's been stiffened in yes,"Yeah, sort of starchy, rigid fabric.",2
uh i mean i have other things to complain about but in terms of uh woman's roles um things really seem a lot more flexible,I have other stuff to complain about but it seems like woman's roles are a lot more flexible these days.,2
yeah i've heard that that's a really good way to get cars up here they they only come around like once a year in the summertime they have a state auction but but they don't um they don't repossess that many cars up here figure in a big metropolitan area there would be a lot of uh where they repossess they uh take their cars for illegal activities you know it,The cars were repossessed for involvement in drug-related crimes.,0
i'm not sure i'm not sure if it's a way to cut down government expenses or it's like you said that's something more you know to to make people aware,This is something to curb spending or it's just an awareness program.,2

yeah that's uh it's been a problem that i've noticed a lot in print that uh um once you have collected this what do you do with it because there's not a whole lot of companies that are taking it there's a lot of people that want to participate and given the facilities will participate and they've proven that time and time again,Many individuals would like to participate.,2
oh that would be really tough,It would be very difficult in that case.,2
or if they would allow them to uh give broader answers they it's really kind of uh choreographed it's like a script has been written when people testify they aren't testifying really in their own words,"When they speak, it seems completely honest and genuine.",1

two percent two percent is a good choice but to as far as to increase tax revenues coming in you need to a redesigning of the entire tax structure itself corporate America is getting away with bloody murder where as the people out here are having to pay such a high amount of their actual bring home salaries into taxes the corporations are getting off easy because they're actually paying in less than five percent of their gross national product or their or their,Taxes for the corporations are exorbitant and should be lowered.,1

eventually the at the hospital they said no to the doctor and they found out it wasn't even his electrocardiogram that there was some other patient you know by the time he'd been sent back to the nursing home and,"He got tired of the hospital, and asked to go back to the nursing home.",0

you know i i agree with that because i see people that i know a again from high school that i still keep in touch with that didn't go to college and,I still keep in touch with people from high school that didn't go to college and they are all doing well.,0
well as time grew by and i think i had my daughter with me one time and she went strolling away and i saw this kid and i patted her on the head and the mother turned around and saw me and took the kid away  you know pulled the kid and i,The mother was okay with me touching her child's head.,1
well if it ain't uh well you know uh,Maybe it's not.,2
um yeah some i guess like what do you mean like like are you talking about movies like Die Hard Two or,Do you like Die Hard Two?,0
and uh it really makes it look professional and i've taken some classes here in in uh Dallas,It enables a more put together finish and I am getting instruction at a place in Dallas.,2
uh Doug Flutie's the only one that sticks out in my head for some reason,I can't think of anyone offhand.,1
so if you pay your uh rent or your house payment every two weeks instead of once a month you'll come out paying a,I pay my rent every two weeks instead of monthly.,0
because without it you can be broke for the rest of your life,If you don't have it you can be poor the rest of your life. ,2
hundreds of thousands of people is what it seemed like,There were a lot of people at the concert.,0
yeah i know it's like they were using them as friends when we were having the conflict but i i you know it's almost where i'm kind of disappointed with the Iranians why they didn't go save save i mean i don't know if the Kurdish i know the Shiite's are their people but i don't know i think they have a bond with the the Kurds,When we were having times of peace we were using them as our enemies. ,1
well so much of it is game playing with the lawyers they're plea doing their plea bargaining and and uh give and take type situation that uh they're playing with people's lives in effect uh by offering uh to uh uh offering to announce their guilt to a certain degree on a crime in order to get uh a lighter uh sentence sentence,Plea bargaining is a game. ,2
yeah that that's that's the part that i don't like too,"No, I don't agree, I love this part!",1
right what about if if um they demanded to have Spanish as the official language as a condition for statehood,I have no problem with Spanish being the new official language.,1
you know like a year old it was ridiculous and she's got two day cares within like three blocks of each other yes so its i mean she's,There are two day cares within three blocks of each other.,2
yeah that i hate  you know and laser seminar that they had i don't know if you've seen the book,I did not enjoy the laser seminar that they had.,0
yeah i mean look who's taking the the engineering jobs and the and the math jobs and the science jobs you know they're all Orientals,None of the jobs in math are science are being taken.,1
yeah well um i've never fully served i mean i've been asked twice to go down but i didn't get elected on the panel but i know that um for a lot of the civil cases it's rare i mean if your a lawyer um there you could be a lawyer who never actually gets into the courtroom there's a lot of attorneys like that that never get to the courtroom,attorneys prefer to avoid going to the courtroom,0
twenty year old and he uh he's in love with this girl that's about sixteen or seventeen and they leave he's involved with like a murder and then um he they go to uh they go to like Louisiana and Texas and uh he get they get more he gets more involved with this robbery and whatever but it's sort of,A twenty year old is in love with a younger girl.,0
stuff toward i mean i don't know if if you saw those but i thought she was treated badly at for being a woman frankly i really did by by uh,She was only treated badly because she was a woman.,0
no i live in Maryland,Sorry but I live in Maryland.,2
and that's coming right into your homes,That's entering your homes.,2
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh i know my brother had trouble with fire ants and that even uh yeah and they be can be a real dickens,Fire ants are the worst bugs to deal with.,0
uh-huh and Warren Moon is is proving himself quite well right now,Warren Moon is way off right now.,1
i really do and it's only fair to the children i think making giving the children an out that they don't have to speak English is just encouraging them to drop out later on because they'll never make it through high school,It just encourages the children to drop out of school and not finish high school.  ,2
yeah yeah it becomes a kind of music of it's own i mean when you listen to it it's um uh i think that they don't use electronic electronic some of it it's it's they use electronic and acoustic interchangeably,The electronic music is so upbeat.,0
i i would be impressed i mean you know,I'm not impressed at all.,1
there is a whole lot of stuff going on out there and and part of me says i just would like to you know shut my eyes and pretend it doesn't you know go on or send them to private schools and then the you know the old social conscience says you know i'm not working i don't need to work maybe i should volunteer to you know teach what i know,I wish I could send them to private school. ,2
yeah yeah really i mean Switzerland is so clean,I didn't have to deal with any waste or litter in Switzerland. ,0
well uh a couple years ago we we purchased an uh well it wasn't new it wasn't new it was a a a an Astro van and,We bought a new Honda Civic two years ago.,1
that's right yeah well i i know exactly how you feel,I don't know how you feel about that.,1
as far as me personally i think it made me appreciate my husband more because he doesn't do certain things that my dad did so i,I appreciate my husband less since he's the same as my father.,1
so everything really that's what's really cut into my TV watching is the time that everything comes on since it's all shifted back an hour i just i don't really have time to stay up late and since i have to get up so early to go to classes,"I can't watch much TV because it is on too late, and I have to get up early for classes.",2
oh yeah they they they have uh like uh a guard with locks we've been there once at night at Christmas she just went in last year,We have never been there before and don't know if it is locked or not.,1
i can see now when you've been there a while though they were talking about random testing it seems like if there's no reason to suspect you,They do random testing.,2
and uh you would just hate it so much that whatever you had to do would be just you know it's like you know,you'd loathe it so much that you would do absolutely anything to get out of it,0
but uh yeah i i usually don't get home until eight o'clock so that's another good reason but,"One good reason, is that I don't get home until eight o'clock.",2
well you ought to try a muffin if you haven't,I know you have tried the muffin.,1
you go during the week,The journey takes all days between Monday and Friday. ,0
yeah so it's been fairly recent,It was ages ago that it happened.,1
gee whiz yeah,Yes indeed.,0
yeah well like i said though my my change my taste in in food really hadn't changed all that much in in restaurants i mean a little bit yeah uh especially in you know i didn't have the money to go to these dinner theaters and stuff before,My food in taste has never really changed and I don't expect it to. ,1
so he goes well if you go to bed at eight then you'll wake up like six in the morning,"If you go to bed by eight, you'll wake up at five in the morning.",1
because without it you can be broke for the rest of your life,Without it you can be rich the rest of your life. ,1
i mean i was absolutely flabbergasted at what she they would that she was paid true she was young you know but still it's the principle of course if she got her Master's degree it'd all be different but uh,I was stunned at the low salary she was paid.,2
yeah and we've taken our tents though loaded them up in car carrier and decided we were going to tent most of the way and it ended up when it came time for us to pull in for the night we'd take a vote and most of the time we decided we wanted to stay in a hotel,We camped the entire way and never even though about staying in a hotel.,1
well i suspect that that's a reference to Thoreau's Fish in the Bucket of Milk but i don't know for sure and i'm not sure what the relevance would be if it were but,I think that might be a reference to Thoreau's Fish in the Bucket of Milk.,2
now that's an idea don't say that too loud though because uh every city and town will have a meter on your  tailpipe generate  generate revenue,"It might work, but it would suck.",2
child care seems to be uh a uh a topic that varies i guess with where you are geographically if you're in an area where you got a lot to select from then i guess there are a lot of criterias to choose from but if you're in an area where there's two or three then uh you get what you can take,People in Texas have ideas about child care that are very different from people in Oklahoma.,0
oh yeah i think that i i guess it was uh five years ago or more than when they it failed and i guess people just got tired of talking about it i'm not too sure i guess there was no one really pushing it and no one saying that it was going to mean business to us i think nowadays,It was very successful five years ago and people are still talking about it today.,1
and one of the things that uh well they were really selling everybody on back then was this Indian Hawthorne boy you know that's the best stuff in the world,They made us hate the Indian Hawthorne boy.,1
it was uh of course he had to fight that to beat microscope anyway,He didn't need to fight at all.,1
at my uh my uh mother-in-law's house and uh,at my mother in law's house.,2
yeah and and you've got to go over there and try it and i suppose you know i need a larger one i need a smaller one i mean obviously you can look at it and say well anyway i think the other thing that's interesting is that a lot of our stuff is already changed that we haven't i don't know do you do you drink adult beverages,I find it intriguing that all of our stuff has stayed the same.,1
uh-huh well Houston's playing really well lately,Houston has been playing awfully lately,1
yeah yeah i lived in a town it was a college town in Virginia and i mean people kept their lawns mowed but they sure didn't get into like they do here in Texas wasn't a source of pride or something like it is down here,I never lived in a college town in Virginia.,1
exactly yeah just economic overall economic uh times around here in Texas have been tough,Economic times in Texas have been tough.,2
um-hum yep my husband likes the weights period that's it he wants to be up like he wants to he says i'm going to pump up i said uh-huh,He doesn't like weights because it allows too movement. ,1
all right good talking to you Brad take care bye,The person is very happy to end the conversation with Brad. ,0
right that's right it's it's the same way here how long have you lived in Lubbock,It is the same way of life here and where you come from.,2
the benefits are funny,The benefits are infuriating.,1
yeah that that's possible i still think that that a lot of those people are the ones who really think that their votes don't make a difference though as well i think it's those same people who don't know any better about how we vote are are are a lot of the people who think that well look at me i'm just a little nobody my vote's not going to count anyway you know and i think that's probably a portion of the population that's massively under represented i i i would guess that that that portion of the population is massively under represented and,My opinion on the population's mindset of the voting system is common.,0
right yeah and get that youth back,Get that youth back by playing soccer,0
yeah i haven't heard i hadn't heard much about that movie i other than it was a chop them up movie but uh well i guess that's one i won't go see,I really want to see that movie.,1

who's your favorite team,What team do you like best?,2
sure it is absolutely,Yes it absolutely is.,2
uh-huh yeah because of the stuff settles on it,It gets slippery when the stuff settles on it.,0
two yeah yeah and then of course Indianapolis which is only a hundred miles away from us has the Colts yeah,Indianapolis is not hosting the Colts.,1
all right so you don't have a a lot of paint either,It appears you don't have a lot of paint.,2
it really is awful i think maybe the company should do more with day care centers and that type of thing it might bring families closer,"It is terrible, the business should attempt more actions with day cares which has the chance of bringing families together.",2
yeah oh well that that's another system that i link in to i i network internally to Texas Instruments in Attleboro,"yeah I'm linked to a lot of networks, one is Texas instruments in Attleboro",0
oh boy yeah what kind of a boat do you have,"So what do you like to do out on the water? Boating, jet-skiing, windsurfing?",0
uh-huh you bet and i remember that,There is not guarantee that I will be able to recall that.,1
we don't have the the uh background to maybe make that decision,Perhaps we're unqualified to make that decision.,0
do they have uh actual camp sites there where you can go and,They definitely don't have camp sites.,1
they have some some good buys on them and those are pretty nice i they're they're have a little galley a little uh sink that's got some compressed air and water in it and uh and a little stove that's like a propane stove,The kitchen area had a propane stove and a working sink.,2
as in metric size hole or a or an American sized hole,"It's probably a metric hole, but I thin you might be referring to an American hole?",0
so and and the only other thing i've seen has been the setting up a compost heap in your own backyard,I have heard of many other strategies.,1
yes well i  i don't know anyone who paid cash for a house that's for sure yeah you don't have much um i,I don't know anyone who paid cash for a house; you don't have much cash. ,0
well they're i guess they're pretty popular up this way yeah it's a pretty rugged trailer it's a tandem wheel even though it's only eighteen foot long so there's it drags pretty good you know with a car but,I use the trailer to see national parks.,0
and then when the water comes up it comes on again and we use that to water our garden,"When the water come on again, we use it to water our garden.",2
uh now how that has to deal with stress i'm not really sure since i thought most of the stress had to do with you know from the from the eyes and the mental processes on up i don't know what it would have to do with the connectivity to the rest of the body,i think the stress is obviously related to connectivity with the rest of the body,1
exactly but they took you know whatever the majority was so i didn't know if that was just something for drama or that's truly the way it is i always thought it had to be unanimous,"Out of curiosity, I looked it up and that's the way it truly is.",0
take all thirteen weeks of summer that's less than uh right at a weeks full full uh full week's worth of vacation and i have you know three weeks a year i been long enough to do that,There are 13 weeks of summer.,2
the Belgians try to act like the French,Everybody is unique and tries to act like themselves.,1
yeah that's that's it we'd like to be closer to family but limits the job your welcome Brittany,The person on the phone feels limited by his job when it comes to being around their family.,2
was it i i bet it was i bet i really bet it was  is that the only uh musical do you go see musicals musicals a lot of musicals,Do you see a lot of musicals?,2
i'd recommend it It's a little on the violent side,It tends to be somewhat violent,2
i see what do you all make,Do you work at all?,1
uh well if you know diesels don't require mechanics they require plumbers,Diesels are so messy that they require plumbers instead of mechanics.,0
it there was a lot of pretty scenery too in that movie what did you think about the buffalo scenes,There were no animal scenes in the movie.,1
yeah Sierra hasn't shown that kind of maturity yet,Sierra may eventually show that maturity level,0
or at least they try and do something about it first,They should do something about the prices.,0
as Mexicans yes that that,As Mexicans.,2
that that was the reason i had to replace mine,I had to replace mine for that reason.,2
this year we didn't this last season it was it was too wet up here,It rained so much that the plants thrived this year.,1
Italian heritage so i definitely like pasta but i like Italian and the two don't mix though  i've tried that that doesn't,"I have Italian heritage, but I hate pasta.",1
that's that's in uh Texas stadium where the football players play,The football players play in Texas Stadium next Sunday. ,0
you know i mean you would you know learn enough to get by on the test and then you forgot about it because you knew you were never going to see it again in the rest of your years of school you know and and that that's not the way to convert over you're going to have these kids you know teaching it dually even you know teaching both systems which is a lot i know a lot more for the teachers to have to teach but that's the only way they're going to get switched over you know,Kids can learn both systems if they are interested and research online.,0
and he didn't redo anything so it's it's coming back a little bit now this year,He redid everything.,1
no yeah i don't know why they expect it's going to start this week you know,I know why they expect it to start this week.,1
then i mean all all of us are going to answer to it one day maybe or maybe not i don't know i mean no one's said for sure you know,"Everybody is going to answer to that one day, but few are sure, you know?",0
and then you can kind of keep an eye and you can make judgments and make comments or whatever you want but at least you see what's going on and uh you always have your house welcome then then your children'll think that uh you know you're cool parents and all that you know,It's good to let your kid's friends come over and be honest because they'll like you.,0
and and unfortunately and i think cocaine's a a good example it's it's just so much easier to just do some more do some more and then before you know it you know you're you're always doing it,"Cocaine is very addictive and before you know it, you are always doing it.",2
they always have to think you know what's the weather doing and,They've always got to consider the weather.,2
i could not do either well enough i couldn't put in enough overtime that was necessary or that you know things that would come up at work that would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on Saturdays,I could not stay late at work nor go in on Saturdays when it was necessary.,2
but it's it has a much sharper flavor and it's uh,The flavor is more intense and pleasant than anything anyone's ever tasted. ,0
all taken up yeah,There are still some left.,1
yeah yeah i mean you figure there's got to be more to life than sitting here playing with this child,You may feel like you have a greater purpose in life than taking care of children.,2
uh transportation expenses i guess you own a car,I think the reimbursement rate is fifty five cents per mile.,0
well in South Africa yeah well in South Africa yeah In South Africa i think they are but yet you know Idi Amin was you know in power for so long,Idi Amin was in power in South Africa for three decades.,0
yeah you have to get pretty far out of the Dallas area to uh be able to see the stars and uh we do that on the camp outs,The sun shines brightly over the city.,1
um-hum um-hum um-hum how do you feel about it must be a somewhat different environment from a regular college how does that uh,What are the main differences between this environment and usual college?,0
to deny that at least you know the majority of it is true so you know you know it depends on how you look at it,Depends on how you look at it but at least you know most of it is the truth.,2
and that's what i i know people who don't have any credit cards at all and i'm always amazed  because i don't know how they can get by without them it doesn't seem like you can do anything anymore without a credit card,I am amazed at how people can live without credit cards.,2
um we're having unusually warm weather it's it's almost like they're trying it's trying to skip spring and go straight to summer it's either,The weather lately hasn't been any different than before.,1
right and and it doesn't make any difference either if you if you eat some of that stuff and you can drink a gallon and it doesn't seem to put out the fire but,"You could drink lots, but that would not help put out the heat.",2
okay have you ever served as a juror,Have you ever been convicted of a crime?,1
i don't know but that sounds like my kind my kind of camping it really does yeah okay um well um that that is the best way to do it is to have a a nice vehicle where you can have everything in it plus your tent,I think camping in a vehicle is ideal.,2
yeah if you wanted to you could uh but you could do the whole presentation and slick it up and edit it and make all kinds of changes and modification till you had it down pat on the Amiga once you had done that i mean including hooking up a camera to take pictures of things like maybe you want to do a a a a presentation on how to run some piece of gear well you want to take pictures of it you might want to take pictures of it running,Amiga was the first computer to feature presentation software.,0
that's right you know it gives me a paycheck you know it's only like the works only you know three weeks goes for like three to four weeks three times a year,Do you get paid for a full paid job or a contract?,0
and you didn't you didn't have any notice you know so like if you were doing drugs then like you didn't have a way you know to stop i mean it was still in your body,If you were doing drugs there was no opportunity to stop them from finding out with the tests.,2
good grief that would be hard to do you know,Doing that would be difficult.,2
the good ole boys with the pickup and the rifle on the back and the quart of beer down your down between your legs driving down the road,The good old boys running big companies from skyscrapers.,1
we i guess we both agree that it's a good thing that they should do sometime well you take care and and enjoy the day thank you ma'am bye-bye,This is the first thing that we agree on regarding what they should do.,0
what do you do for the surprise things that you don't necessarily plan for the you know are sometimes several hundred dollars like uh tires for the car or car repair of some sort or like a a dental bill or something that you're not prepared for,Surprise expenses aren't something that ever come up. ,1
but well i guess it's getting late,Plenty of time left.,1
um that's something that i'd be very interested in very interested in learning,"I would like to learn more about that, if I can.",0
oh my yeah right right yeah i think and i think that's uh uh part of the problem now i was uh uh i was in engineering myself um right now i'm taking uh a year off but uh it was it's very difficult even when i worked i insisted on working thirty hours not forty so i was really considered part time and that was kind of difficult because that concept when you get into professions like that isn't really there yet so i really had to hound them for that i was a civil engineer,When I worked I insisted on working 30 hours but it didn't go over well.,2
i mean just the very second it's really strange they uh they must uh work on that you know the the it gets cooler when the sun sets and then they all come out,It is an amazing thing.,0
uh uh half the countries in the world simply canceled the Poland debts,Poland was thankful for the forgiven debts.,0
okay we have a that's a fairly large chain in New England we have a a Popaginos um and they had not been delivering up until the time where uh Domino's began delivering and within a matter of six months they started up there own delivery service,Popagino's started delivering after Domino's began delivering. ,2
so oh well i got to go to class now,So I am going to class now.,2
you can look at it if you know if if you want to say that it's proving that it isn't true then you can you very much look at it that way,You can look at if from the viewpoint that it's proving a lie or you can discredit it.,0
on other fronts um,on other frontiers,2
and and you know they can they'll take somebody who maybe is mentally retarded and then it's and they're under pressure to to solve a crime and some and the circumstances uh may be molded to blame somebody who didn't do it and especially if it's you know somebody who's mentally retarded who can't defend themselves very well and i'd hate to see them get the ultimate punishment and it turns out it wasn't them,Someone innocent who is mentally retarded could be framed and get the death penalty for a crime that they didn't commit.,0
oh that's cool,That's chilled from the fridge,0
no i don't like the metric system,I am not used to using the metric system.,0
and like you have your own little code name you know and you'd type in  hi how are you  and they'd type back and everybody and you'd have five or six or seven people talking to each other at the same time and everything everybody said,You would talk to many people while using a code name.,2
i'm not sure that the other camping type of camping is nothing more than a leisure or,No form of camping is leisurely.,1
this is true yeah yeah i think the one thing the the there's a program called uh Habitat For Humanity that Jimmy Carter started the former president and i think i think programs like that with what you just talked about going on in your area local area at and something like that would be good,Jimmy Carter started a program called Habitat for Humanity over five years ago.,0
well you have to prove it to yourself just by doing it a few times,"Don't do it at all, you have nothing to prove to anyone, not even yourself. ",1
uh-huh oh really yeah that's when my nephew's birthday is and he goes well you should have it on the fifteenth so we'll see,My nephew's birthday is on the fifteenth,0
uh my brother's got a collection there they both uh do police work uh they go out and shoot and they're from the mentality that when uh uh guns were against the law only criminals owned them that sort of thing,The police officer had a lot of guns and doesn't think that criminals should own guns.,2
yeah they no i'm i'm sure they probably well it all depends i guess on on what they feel is you know what he can do because baseball is not a light an easy sport either that's a very very athletic sport lot of running and stuff like that and the hip may be a real problem but i i would think that football would have been more of a detriment to him than than baseball would,"Baseball is not a light and easy sport, its very athletic and his hip may be a real problem, though I think football would have been more detrimental than baseball.",2
yeah it's hard to find something that'll take the heat as well as the freezing,Insulation against the freezing cold isn't necessary.,1
oh they get yeah yeah and that's something we don't we get uh we've got on oil fired hot water baseboard,We installed a hot water baseboard last year.,0
do you um do you do you get them do you feel like the newspapers are generally biased either liberal or conservative views,Most newspapers nowadays have some kind of bias.,0
yeah it's a it's a hard decision to make,Deciding whether or not to kill yourself is a hard decision to make.,0
i know and he pulled that out that is so funny i heard it on the radio i heard the audio portion on the radio in the car but i didn't see it but,"That's so funny that he pulled that out, i heard about it on the radio.",2
yeah it it talked about all SMU and their the death penalty and how they're getting around all the regulations and rules and and things of that nature i guess anymore it's just a big business,It talked about how SMU is skirting around the rules and regulations.,2
so look into that bit the year that they graduate you know before though you know while they're graduating there's all kinds of little bitty money that little clubs will give away churches and everything and they don't even have a dozen applicants because uh uh the kids are going off after the big money,"only big organizations give away money, not small clubs",1
uh-huh uh-huh oh right right now i want to see Sleeping With The Enemy,I heard that the plot for the movie was very intriguing.,0
i see but you breed them the first time they go into heat,A cat in heat is terrible. ,0
and and there's no way that you can get him unless it's by force,If you don't use force you can't get him.,2
right exactly i was a i was a Boy Scout and as part of being a Boy Scout you had to do you know projects all throughout and then to become an Eagle Scout you have to spend a do a year long project for,I used to be a Boy Scout.,2
yeah like what,"Yes, what do you think it is like?",2
you know but you still walk in there and go gee what if something i ate what if something i've done what if something i've eaten shows up,I'm not worried about what I've eaten.,1
no yeah you just you just well see at ours uh we're living with my family my folks now so,We've been staying with my parents for the past few months.,0
because uh apparently the foundation shifts a little bit under that,"Because of the earthquakes, I guess the foundation slides around a little bit.",0
yeah um that sounds good,"No, that does not sound good. ",1
or or even have had the ability you know the chance to to go to college or to to to learn about it i think it's still good they do cover the system and i think it should still be taught in schools,"When schools teach it, it helps students to get into colleges.",0
i know it and especially it's hard to keep your interest in those begats,"I know, especially how easy it is to keep your interest in those begats.",1
my dad used to grow tomatoes and things at the house and i'd i think when i was real little i probably had a finger in on that every time he did it and had to you know be out there and watch and that type of stuff but i've never really tried anything like that since then,My dad grew tomatoes.,2
yes that's easier,"No, it's too hard.",1
still it's you know nice to get away from civilization every once in a while and,I like to do this especially when I've been stressed out.,0
well uh i accepted Christ as my Lord and Savior and so i don't use drugs any more,Christ has filled the void where drugs used to be.,0
yeah but isn't isn't the uh the insurance also for for uh Blue Cross so they're not only saying preventable not preventable death they're also saying um that you'll have uh less likelihood of being sick if you don't smoke,The insurance is also for Red Cross and they're saying you will get more sick if you don't smoke.,1
but uh i i don't know i'm i've been Republican for as long as i can remember and the Democrats are just so disorganized and they have been,For as long as I can remember I have been a Democrat. ,1

i've my husband's company does a little bit of profit sharing but my company doesn't and i'd really like it if my company did  they turn quite a profit at times but it's not part of uh what's available so,"I would like my company to also do a bit of profit sharing, so what options are available to me?",0
yeah uh somebody took the fire out from under them they they weren't getting their shots anymore,They missed far more shots than they did in the previous game.,0
yeah well people put me in labor back when they was in the Super Bowl,I was put in labor when they were in the Super Bowl.,2
are they thin long,Are they very thin?,0
right right i i do have some uh retirement modeling that i've done at home that uh tends to crawl uh which on which i've just turned the calculation off in between and a couple of models that i've,"My retirement plan is great, it has had great growth rather quickly.",1
and you're pretty much uh assumed to be guilty until proven innocent by the test results,Considering the test results you're pretty much guilty until proven innocent.,2
uh-huh maybe you expected too much out of it,Maybe you went into Jurassic World with too much expectation.,0
spend a lot of time on the house and out in the yard and things but um i like to keep up to date too um i guess,This house used to belong to a doctor named Poopenshire.,0
well um my grandma speaking of those meatballs again she um every Christmas and and Easter whenever we have at the big get-together over at her house she makes this meat ball sauce and it has i don't know they are just kind of like quarter size meatballs and they are absolutely delicious i don't know what she calls them and i don't i'm sure she puts wine in it because um she cooks everything with alcohol but,My grandma never makes meatballs.,1
yeah that's true that's true well i guess the only other uh things that i like to do you know the oil changes and things that are not worth paying for at least in my neck of the woods so we do that kind of maintenance and,"I do my own oil changes and maintenance, in my area it's to expensive to have someone else do it.",2
put a big cast on it,Let it be with nothing.,1
well have you ever have you ever taken any of those um what do they call this citronella lights have you ever used those,if you have taken citronella lights what do they do,0
yeah but i'm only fifty seven,They are also male.,0
you could yeah you could stand in there if you really wanted to i guess,"If you'd like to wait, you can just stay there.",0
so our our import tax on them is no big deal but their their tax on us and you can't you can't do that plus they can make it cheaper because they don't pay that much,It is more expensive to make anything there.,1
and so he i think he got a real good deal of course they're fully loaded usually so it's i think it's a pretty good option,"they're usually fully loaded, so that deal looks pretty good.",2
and uh i just drove by there this morning and it still looks just as good as it did when we moved out of it thirteen years ago so,I drove by over there at about 6am in the morning.,0
yeah that's on right it's on again tonight,The person is confirming that the show will not be on again tonight.,1
of uh of uh Indian Princess camp and my uh uh my my twenty three year old has has hoarded all the movies now and and and just sets up the projector in her room and watches them every once in a while uh going back to things like that and,My daughter hoards all of the movies and gets angry if others want to use them.,0
oh boy that was lucky,That happened to be lucky.,2
yeah that's what i hear so i'm hoping i think they have a really quick reproduction cycle of only like thirty days or something,Their reproduction cycles is usually thirty two days.,0
i like comedies and i like sitcoms i like to watch TV for escape i'm not much interested in,Watching a sitcom or comedy on TV allows me to escape.,2
uh when they get to junior high school high school and even college i mean my sister went to college um started about three years ago and she had to have a a computer,My sister had to have a computer when she went to college.  ,2
well i have i'm really torn on the subject i'm not a good candidate for this one i see what you see and i agree with you,I cannot see your viewpoint in this instance.  ,1
well i know it's hard for young people to think about giving up their years you know free their carefree years but people that i have known that have done that i like from other countries especially Germany and Finland,Young people from Germany and Finland have few reservations about how they spend their carefree years.,2
so it's now he has the pressure too of being super dad and super career and,He's so fortunate to have no kids and so much time to dedicate to his job.,1
yeah i think the concept's great you know,I think the concept of a new world order where we are being controlled by illuminati is great. ,0
but still it's harmful and they have to live with that every day,They could get sick from being near it every day.,0
well i think we've got uh like a language barrier too i think most of the people there speak only Spanish i'm not sure how fluent they are in English and that's one of the major problems i i see with uh other countries as such being uh say the possibility of becoming states that we don't have a common language with them,Spanish speaking countries should never be allowed statehood.,1
and um  a salad and then for desert i wanted i would i really wanted to make um just brownies or French doughnuts would have been good but it's real hard to make them they don't really come out like they do in New Orleans up here i don't know why,"It is easy to make French doughnuts, I always make them correctly. ",1
so not formally,informally,2
because there are just too many bills,I can't save any money because there are just too many bills.,0
and maybe maybe absent maybe you ought to be able to do it on your telephone you know i mean i don't know,"It would make it easier to vote by telephone, actually.",0
anyway the i appreciate it have a good day,"Thank you, I look forward to talking to you again.",0
you know whenever we he my husband has time off or something we take them to the zoo or we you know we we do everything we can possibly as a family,Our kids love to see the bunnies at the zoo.,0
yeah but the politics the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes,The small towns have no politics.,1
oh here it gets so hot i mean this stuff just burns to a crisp what,It is so hot here that this stuff will burn to a crisp.,2
if they're the kind of people that commit these  excuse me grotesque crimes and have done it over and over and over again you don't reform those kind of people,"You can't reform repeat offenders of grotesque crimes, and we shouldn't try.",0
well i don't know you're you're you're like a boat ride from how how far is it across the lake to Canada Toronto,Most people take the bus to get here. ,0
well it's hard for me,This will get easier for me with practice.,0
and and um i think for food they had steak and beans  and they had three different sizes of steak The cowboy the cowgirl and the,Beef was not available due to religious restrictions. ,1
uh we are latecomers my husband and i to the world of golf we started when we were both oh i would imagine he was fifty years old so we've not been at the game that long but we love it,We didn't golf until after fifty.,2
i realize that that i mean i can take that for granted but i used to i used to live in India and things are quite different there in terms of that there's less of a sense of privacy in fact it's said that no Indian language has a word for privacy certainly a language i know doesn't but just has a word for loneliness loneliness is the closest you can come which is really quite different,I was a garbage man when I lived in India.,0
you know show her what to wear show her how to match up colors and i just thought that was so very exciting you know to go and and just witness,It allowed me to share something I was passionate about.,0
you know they've really become very much involved in in just that one organization  which the organization can use the help too  so i i wish i could see more of that you know,They love to volunteer their time. ,0
no i don't either i just don't have any interest,I am interested.,1
i'm sure that i'll be involved in a big company and i know that my future husband will be you know he's going to be working for Chevron in Houston so he's going to be um,I'll be in a big company and my husband will be with Chevron.,2
oh well that'd be good i think he'd enjoy a lot it's a it's a good school it's a good place to grow up,That is a good school so I am sure he will like it.,2
it is it is really outrageous but uh i mean like whenever i i was growing up and all my mom i never understood this then but i do now but she never would buy me like the new designer jeans that had come out that were thirty dollars or,Mom would not buy me expensive jeans when I was younger.,2
because every time i got through i went to Dallas Texas,i went to Texas in order to find my purpose in life,0
yeah  yeah that was kind of bizarre yeah it's interesting to talk about their marriage their marriage in real life because she had breast cancer and that,In reality she had cancer.,2
and you could get water out of it you know keep cold water,Only warm water came out of it.,1
and the one thing that i did notice is that people that have the underground irrigation systems the sprinkler systems just that was the way to go if you could do it people that were building the new homes that put those in,Most people who are building new homes don't want to spend extra money on sprinkler systems.,0
well i i think what's happened too is just our technology is just advancing so rapidly that and there's so much information available out there that folks out there just have a hard time keeping up aside from just going through their daily routine of living to get from day to day,Our technology is advancing quickly.,2
oh actually i i work for Texas Instruments and um i'm in a i'm an environmental engineer,I've only started working with Texas Instruments last week.,0
oh i go for that yeah,"Oh, I love that.",2
yes uh-huh oh i'd like to go anywhere you know i just like to go,I hate going to most places unless there's something in particular I'm looking for.,1
bonus she no my my wife does,My husband does.,1
how about Ghost,What would Ghost do?,0
if you if you read the book it's uh even better the book was excellent,The book was very good.,2
uh-huh um i haven't really read anything like that in in in years there was a time when i was really into the home things and i did uh had my own garden and i did canning all those kind of things that was when i was about uh ten years younger,"I hate working around the home, even now.",1
you and your dog huh hey that sounds great well we don't we don't camp quite as much as we used to but uh i still think it's a great way to spend a time with your family and,"I think camping is a great way to spend time with family, even though we don't do it as much as we used to. ",2
i really feel like that TI's decision to go with drug testing was good you know because i i feel like that you know well all all it takes is one person coming to work under the influence of some narcotic um truly injure a lot more of our workers,TI decided to opt for drug testing and I think that was a good thing.,2
yes oh yes no i'm busy right now Steven Steven wants me to do popcorn right now okay,I have something I am doing at the moment.,2
i didn't realize that had happened for some reason,I knew it happened.,1
um-hum that's true but uh i do like the idea of the jury being the the the people who decide in the matter of uh if it's a jail term versus life and death,That's correct but I like the idea of a group of people deciding whether a criminal gets life or a death sentence.,2
uh not originally,Originally it was very different.,0
i am in uh in uh involved in a four 401K but i'm uh contributing such a such a small amount right now,I don't have any plans for a 401k.,1
uh-huh well i think so it puts you out on your own and and in a time after high school um,"During a time after high school, it will put you on your own.",2
uh its it's it's really looking at systems and design systems and seeing how people interact with them huh,I'd love to see how you interact with the system. ,0
oh no because were fixing to move,We never want to move from here.,1
you realize it,You didn't realize it,1
but they need to pay for it too because they couldn't do that somewhere else,"Oh no, they don't have to pay for it",1
we don't need that type we don't need that type of graphics that's just not necessary,Yeah I like those kinds of graphics,1
some some big fellows not out there trying to stomp you into the ground you know i mean but uh i that that's surprising i i was i had not heard that in the in the,"Of course some of the big guys do want to run you into the ground, but that is the game.",0
uh for quite a while we was using them to uh i think even one time we used it to pay our rent,Our landlord did not accept it.,1
yeah that that's one of the i think the hard things right now i mean they're going through some some tough times  to say the least uh i know many of us are thankful that he still has a job,We really like him as a teacher and we're glad that he wasn't fired.,0
uh-huh yeah yeah that's kind of funny too as a matter of fact some of them a a bit embarrassing,It's funny and a bit embarrassing.,2
oh well i mostly watch public television so yeah i'm one of those i uh,I mainly watch public TV because it's free in my area. ,0
um the the tax attorney,I don't know anything about tax attorneys.,1
bear bait,Polar bear bait.,0
yeah that's right that's right i know,"""I know that's right and it cannot be changed.""",0
and and all the white water and noise and the it was just beautiful,The noise and the white water was gorgeous. ,2
exercise tends to be a a topic that i guess i've never developed any will power to maintain any regular program i uh,I have been in a regular program for three years now.,1
for a returned check so now she's already doubled the price of her check and i've s ent it through a second time because they said there's money in the account now,It is legal to charge double the face value of a returned check.  ,0
you know whenever we he my husband has time off or something we take them to the zoo or we you know we we do everything we can possibly as a family,We sometimes go to the zoo without them.,1
when i do um crochet it's usually the lacy Victorian type,I only do three types of crochet.,0
and so they go you know who who who what does it matter who i vote for,Is who I voted for really a matter of concern?,2
neither of us had any help with our college degrees and just this last month we paid off my final school loan so  we're starting our kids a little bit early,We don't want our kids to have to worry about paying for college. ,0
and i think that's what you know i think it really uh that's what makes it very makes it difficult and uh this year's much more relaxed,This year is more relaxing than the last one.,0
yeah Salzburg nice Austria nice Europe is nice,Europe is a nice place to visit.,0
that's that's true i've well at least i've heard that i i i haven't fortunately been in a situation where it's been applicable to me but,I have never been in a situation where it's applicable to me because I have never left my house.,0
which seeming rather ironic,I don't see the irony at all.,1
hum-um it should be never it should that should have a cutoff time just like uh uh statutes of limits and everything all that other stuff you know they they should have like within one year so that they'd have enough time for an appeal and uh you know get that stuff out of the way and if it's turned down the the you know after that if if two people have said it then two is enough,"Because of statutes of limitations, they should have a cut-off time of a year to give time for an appeal.",2
yeah i think so i think it's an investment in your future even if it's purely not not religious you can at least say that it's important to our country that our family unit stays strong,Our children benefit a lot if our families are close and strong.,0
and you've got that Southern accent,and you have a Southern accent.,2
yes and i hate it  how about you,I absolutely love it! And you?,1
and i asked my roommate if she would teach me how to crochet granny squares so she did and i crocheted a blanket for my sister's baby,I taught my roommate how to knit socks. ,1
but diesel engines,Diesel engines are expensive.,0
and we're expecting a snowstorm tomorrow into Friday,The weather report say that we will be getting six inches of snow.,0
but you know i'm not so totally hung up on that that i wouldn't buy something else how about you,"I completely need to buy this right now, I have been searching for it forever!",1
how did they end up this year did they did they make it to the play-offs at all,I started following the team but by the end of the season wasn't paying any attention. ,0
they had uh kind of uh i don't know if you call it stand down or whatever but anyway they stopped and wait to see if Iraq would accept a permanent cease fire situation though as i understand it from the Iraqi point of view this current cease fire thing that the UN uh had set up you know the Iraqis are probably not going to go for at all unless they're just absolutely forced to,There would be no getting the Iraqis to stand down without force.,0
that's the other financial thing i guess that we've done is with our life insurance is since i'm at home now is is figuring out uh what we would need if something happened to my husband or what he would need if something happened to me,We don't want life insurance.,1
and and i and i understand the way they feel about their husbands and wives being over there and all that but to get on camera and just oh  this is so terrible i just i don't what we're going to do well i'm thinking to myself,I think to myself a lot when something bothers me.,0
well of course Dachshunds and Dachshunds like chocolate i i remember i remember that other one too he was always after somebody's chocolate bar,Dachshunds like chocolate and I remember the other always wanted chocolate too.,2
uh-huh uh-huh that's true they are a lot i guess that's the number one reason why i'm i'm not really ready to have a pet too much  i kind of consider these gerbils just kind of something you look at,I do not think you should just look at gerbils.  ,1
yeah well actually we can we can i can take a highway the whole way down but it's still it's um,The highway is a straight shot. ,2
she'd be big i don't know  what are you saying Holly oh my little girl is in the second grade and told me to tell you that shboom means good-bye in the Israeli language,My daughter knows no israeli.,1
uh painting is not hard to do uh as long as it's not in not to the point of where it's uh needs to be scraped and bleeding and peeling,It's easy to paint.,2
why where are you from,Where are you from?,2
uh-huh and all on the job too you know it had gotten that bad,"While things were good at first, they worsened over time.",0
they get snow up there but it's it's not a long lasting snow it'll be there they may have a week of it then it warms back up into the high thirties and forties,They do not have long periods of snowfall up there.,2
um-hum yeah well it seems like it would develop pride you know in people if if it's in their own country it would certainly help them to appreciate some of the,People are more prideful if something is from their country,2
after a certain amount of years of service these employees can take off like six months or something for some type of sabbatical or some you know some something like that,The employees don't get any time off from work.,1
now that's we we don't have that that's neat,I wish we could have that.,0
and uh right right now our daughter our well she's our second oldest she has she's the only that other one that has children she has two boys and she works full time and i have mixed feelings about that she's able to do that and i don't know if she'd be happy to stay at home but yet on the other hand i i've got the mixed feelings that i think you should be at home with your children i'm kind of old fashioned i guess that way but they seem to they seem to give uh quality time,It is important for the mother to be at home.,0
right yeah yeah i have little children four and one and i decided that it was very important to me to stay home um and,My wife is away a lot due to being a politician so we decided I should stay at home to look after the children. ,0
uh-huh i think we do to,I don't think we do.,1
i mean you're just with them,You're totally not like them.,1
uh what i've gotten into more recently are the tools to use them have you,You have to learn how to use the tools first.,0
you know i think it might be up to two hundred and fifty thousand it's gotten big,It's only up to one hundred dollars sadly.,1
i know i know it's true,I know that's correct.,2
we couldn't call in they said it would be up Friday the March the fifteenth before it was prepared so i missed several days because i was getting quite a few calls,It cannot be accessed after March 15th at all.  ,0
well i like the classics too uh i think that there's a lot of books out now that are kind of garbage books and i well i don't prefer to read a lot of the things like you might find at uh well like at a Target or a supermarket or something where they have a bunch of books out paperback type books usually i,I like classics since they are better than many of the books available.,2
um-hum right uh yeah we can get uh you know if we get someone in there like that then you know they could make all sorts of changes if they were you know had enough pull,"If you introduced a newcomer with enough pull, they would face too much resistance to change.",1
it got warm it was pretty smelly by the time we got there which is not too far a drive but,The garbage is what made things smell horrible.,0
oh oh i do i really do i think it's great,Oh I don't think that's good actually.,1
but i understand why i i know one problem is uh why people don't don't register to vote i i know some personally because in the past and i think that's been changed that that's how they get the jury uh rolls from from voter registration but i think that's going to be changed,People who don't vote are helping the situation quite a bit.,1
well you know TI you know TI offers some good stuff and then i think there's i mean i think there's some negatives but there's going to be some negatives anywhere you know no matter where you go i have you know all this is the first really large company i've worked for i've always been involved in little small you know individual privately owned  owned firms and so i've never had the the big benefit package so i really don't know how to compare it to other big companies you know it when i came on it was great see because i had never had anything even close to what what they offered so i've been real pleased,I looked at the benefit package of this large company and thought it was wonderful.,0
you know so i think it depends on how much trouble that kids has been in you know,I think allowance depends on how much trouble kids have been in.,0
so we built the dog run down the length of our uh back yard because the kids were getting i mean we couldn't even let our older son until he was about two i guess he was two when we built the dog run we couldn't let him go out in the back yard because it was we have a deck with a rail and he could go on that but the dogs were so big and he was so little you know they just even walking by him they'd knock him down and the whole back yard had poop in it all the time,"It was always really fun, but there was always lots of poop.",0
their parents so much more than than my children do you know and,My kids' friends don't see their parents much.,0
yes we have a house with a big backyard for the kids to play in and a pretty good size front yard, Our house has a big backyard that the kids love to play in and a pretty good size front yard. ,2
and so that's what they were trying to do with the tax situation and of course that's when he said well you render unto Caesar's what is Caesar's you render unto God what is God's and uh,The tax situation has invoked a controversial discussion.,0
i got one tonight about six thirty when i sat down to eat dinner carpet cleaning,I normally eat at about that time after work.,0
no it  was great,It was terrific.,2
little bit,A small bit.,2
yeah so that's that's a good way to do it and when we bought this house we looked at doing a fifteen year note because it it added more to the payment but not significant amounts you know it was it was a good payoff for being able to pay it off sooner,Mortgages are good ways of financing real estate purchases.,0
i know yeah so you haven't done that before,You're going to do that for the first time.,0
every now and then i'll go ahead and make another tape and uh record a bunch of uh old tunes like the Loving Spoonful and Grateful Dead something from the Birds Rolling Stones,I have never made a tape of old tunes.,1
but uh we usually go to uh a lake area you know where the campsites are and do that uh,"We go to a lake area to camp, so we pitch a tent and then go fishing.",0
well i guess that's it for camping huh,I guess the information in that letter is it for camping huh?,0
and that's why i said that's it i either have to quit or you know try something else so i went on third shift,Third shift was late but allowed me to tend to my other responsibilities.,0
yeah i don't know how you can really keep uh the inside of a tent clean other other than you know taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something,You have to leave your shoes on the keep it clean.,1
right that's true plus what what there will be of it even if it's there isn't quite enough anyway so,There might not be enough.,2
but at at least i guess we're so far ahead of some of the other countries uh that we've still got a better system and and we are we have been doing this for two hundred years so uh uh i guess it's still better that a lot of others,We have a worse system than other countries.,1
yeah oh that oh man i i couldn't be a cop for that for that very reason you know because they do the the criminal gets right back out and you know the cop's just got to go back and and do his thing all over again because so many of the crimes are are done by repeat offenders it's,"If a person has been in prison, it is impossible for them to commit another crime.",1
Maryland well they've got a couple of places here i'm in i'm calling from Texas um there's a place that you know i can feed the five of us for under fifteen dollars and and it's all you can eat and uh that that's the kind of place that you take the kids to,The food is of low quality.,0
oh good luck  we wound up selling the house actually i i don't know whether it made actually it does it's interesting that the white um,We ended up selling the house for a lot more than we paid for it. ,0
that they that they had to put in and basically it was a uh repayment for for uh high school education,Good thing we don't have to repay for high school education.,1
yes it's certain crimes uh capital crimes murder of course uh rape this sort of thing,It is for all crimes.,1
and i've seen this  actually i spent seven years overseas with TI and while i was gone,TI is an interesting person to be overseas with.,0
yeah no we're we're not we're not the Tar Heels, we are the Tar Heels,1
oh yes she likes yeah she likes to she likes to type too it's even fun when i'm on CompuServe and i keep getting all these odd key strokes up there,"My cat will tap on the keys, it looks like she is typing. She will sometimes actually spell a word right.",0
yeah every three thousand miles i'll change the oil i've got about ninety four thousand miles on the car right now,This has kept my motor in top shape.,0
um-hum and and you're staying within your budget and keep everything is working pretty good,You're spending more than you're allowed to.,1
uh-huh oh is there anything else,Is there anything else?,2
really well i'll have to remember that because uh hopefully we won't have them this year but we have a cat that comes in and out and the cat was getting um fleas and stuff and bringing them in the house so we had a real problem last year with fleas and it was uh quite a drag because um we got them in our house and we're Christians and we prayed that we could get rid of these fleas and we got rid of them believe it or not with smoke bombs which is just about impossible to do but we did and so we don't want them back this year you know so i'll remember that if we see it's a problem in the yard we almost they were so bad last year even ticks it i don't know we've had ticks before a lot and we've had to get out and treat our lawn for that i think we used Dursban we used Dursban and Diazinon and get out there and do what you do with that thing you know and spread it all out everywhere but that's about the extent of our lawn care so i don't know do you enjoy doing it,We used bait to kill them.,1
well i mean it's more our fault than theirs at this point because they they saw the light um i don't know why they were um were more able than we were except i think that they probably just said well we're just going to start using the things now and you sort of have to force people to change since they don't want to,It's more our fault but still partially their fault.,0
and i haven't uh been cursed or blessed with either depending on the way you look at it,I have been cursed and blessed.,1
other than that oh have they um-hum do they well good,"Oh they finished the science project, good. ",0
well i'm only a little bit familiar with the Red Sox because i lived up in Boston for a while,I lived in Boston for four years.,0
uh through most of the eighties so i each each year i just sold my tickets i had some people take custody of my tickets for me i served uh three years four years in Malaysia and three in the Philippines,I sold my tickets since I was in Malaysia and the Philippines.,2
but i also blame some of it on parents,I blame most of it on kids but some on parents,0
we had two trees in the front of our yard and then one of them died and so that's where we keep putting that pecan keeps dying we have uh i think it's a Silver Leaf Maple or something like that that's hung on out there,It is easier to maintain the Silver Leaf Maple.  ,0
yeah it's it's it's just the you know here you to the logistics of the thing again you know who,You should know how this works,2

It helps to keep people socialized and give them things to fo.",0
there were several credit cards and then there were several other businesses but uh i i guess what's interesting have you seen the uh the the the the ads where they're offering to extend payments on uh things like uh like the credit union's offering,The offerings from all the various companies was a bit overwhelming.,0
and i always thought that that that was a big rip off uh,I always thought that wasn't enough.,1

just how can anything happen like this and the guys that did it were so ignorant they didn't even remorse they didn't they didn't have any remorse for what they were doing but they were just so ignorant that one of them says well i didn't realize that was because i was beating her in the head that she was really going to die on me you know it's like although why did you do it she was screaming all i wanted to do was shut her up he he acted like he didn't even think that this was going to kill her i the kids were really quite ignorant about it and it it was a tragedy on both sides but it just shocked the uh the state that something like this could happen,The men who commit domestic violence should be punished heavily. ,0
and it was a new Ford so the automobiles that that i have uh,The Ford was second hand,1
i'm at work yes,"Yep, I am speaking to you from my desk where I work.",0
yeah yeah i'd i don't have much sympathy for people that are uh uh victimizing others on a regular basis you know if it's a one time offense and and the kid learns his lesson and uh shows remorse and promises never to do something again and they take some steps to educate him in the matter uh it's it's one thing but when they're there over and over again and uh guilty of the same crimes uh nothing seems to help,I don't have sympathy for repeat offenders. It seems like education helps in some cases of reform but not all.,0
well he doesn't care as long as he's feeding his uh his family,He doesn't mind so long as his family is fed.,2

alrighty  um well i uh have have a four year old who will just be entering public school next year so i'm really just starting to get involved in uh in what's out there and how they do things um as as far as the system as a whole i really don't see a a problem with it i do see a problem with graduating people that that can't read and are not you know productive in society or productive to themselves and uh i think that's the main problem at this point how about yourself,I really want to make a difference in society. ,0
no no i think i think he'd rather commit suicide than turn himself in because there's i mean there's like it's like there's no hope you know like what Hitler did you know like if you were going to put on trial you get to live the rest of your life but where,He's a man who will not be taken prisoner by anyone.,0

but um you know if i don't know that i would go back as often if it wasn't for the idea that i have fun there,"It's mostly nostalgia that makes me think I have fun there, otherwise I wouldn't go as often.",0
thank you it's nice to have someone understand that,I appreciate that there is someone who gets it as well.,2
and that's got uh a hundred and sixteen thousand miles on it and that runs perfectly well too,That car has under a hundred thousand miles and has a lot of problems.,1

i think maybe that we could do better with the budget if we didn't buy so much stuff overseas,The budget would be better if we bought local.,2
an interesting uh point about sentencing by the judge alone doing away with a jury i don't know if i'd be willing to accept the um abuses that would come along with that and that the it would be relatively easy to get some bad decisions or to even get to the judge from a standpoint of bribery but,Interesting point about sentencing by the judge I don't know if i'd accept the abuses that would come along with that unless some changes were made.,0

and i was sore this morning when i got up but then tonight i got into a a it's sort of like an aerobics class,I will suffer at my exercise class tonight with these aches. ,0
well Brinkley was sort of trying to be in the mold,Brinkley was attempting to be something.,2
and and and when they're available like that people who normally wouldn't do things like that but momentarily fly off the trigger,When they're available the most unsuspecting people fly off the handle. ,2
oh i know i know oh yeah it's true and i don't think that that burden should be put on companies either i don't think that they should have to assume the responsibility of paying for the person's health care,I think companies should be responsible for paying for the person's healthcare. ,1
or if i had the space i live in a pretty small apartment and uh i would have to you know put stuff away i have two cats so i couldn't really leave it out if i was working on something so reading is a little bit easier to work around,I have no problems.,1

but well hey i appreciate the conversation,I didn't like the conversation.,1
that's uh i think i think that's getting a little more common too,I think that is getting more common for a good reason.,0
oh yeah well the thing that really did it for me i was subbing in a fifth grade class and uh this kid comes to school with his lunch box and inside this lunch box he's got easily two i'd say two hundred two hundred and fifty dollars in one dollar bills,The kid had a large amount of money in a single lunch box. ,2
and the little girl told me that the only reason you called the police is because i'm black and the little two year old sister she had with her she patted her on the leg and said see what happens when your black honey you'll live with this your whole life,The little girl said that the police only came because she was black.,2
toward the top end if i i can put my you know i think to myself if i had that much money,"If I had that much money, I would be on the top end.",2
it can it can be fun i if you have the time but you know a lot of times it's too it's too much of a rush really be able to enjoy it,It can be fun if you have the time.,2
and i slipped and fell in,There was a banana peel on the floor which made me slip,0
and it's it's quite a bit i think six something is the state and and uh the rest of the pie goes elsewhere but we're in a particular part of the state that's pretty well off so it's it's like we get a lot of that back as far as local taxation goes,The rest of it goes somewhere else in the state.,2
but at least because i back up to um a hillside where the uh wild animals are i think i can probably justify it,"The wild animals can really scare you, so I have to back up.",0
yeah uh it's it's just a another form of identification you know just to,"No, that's not a valid form of identification",1
and and at least i had the opportunity of seeing two families move into decent housing um course on the other hand i can start complaining very loudly about people on public assistance who are quite capable of doing something for themselves but just won't,I saw two families become homeless.,1
so my husband's just discouraged me on those things,My husband has encouraged me on those things. ,1
and uh that you weren't allowed to have a uh mustache or a beard and uh you know jeans just flat out weren't allowed unless you worked on night stock and,They had a restrictive dress code.,0

i think i've seen most of Humphrey Bogart's movies but in in you know a long time ago and uh like the Maltese Falcon and all those uh,I never saw Bogart's movies.,1
you know it's like all of a sudden when there's noticeable things saying hey you know we're ruining the earth you know and now everybody is doing something about which is good,"everyone is so apathetic that it's hard to get them to do anything, even now",1
that's a pretty good deal,"The deal you're offering is a little too good, and I'm worried you're accidentally giving your money away.",0
that's so how often do find yourself going um on a if you're doing it on a regular basis how often do you go,I don't care how often you do.,1
oh okay yeah um-hum well oh this is uh this is great this was the first one i had,I hope they are all good.,0

i guess what makes me think of that you know uh you hear them doing that like it's a or like Amtrak you know if if they have a derailment or or transportation industry it seems like if there's accidents train accidents things like that they test and i think well why not because we do have some large industrial accidents sometimes,The Amtrak derailments are always studied intensely ,0
i know now  come on,Ii know that is ridiculous.,0
yeah yeah but uh those overhangs and things do have to be painted you know every four or five years and i bought a uh a power roller that uh it's really designed for indoor use but it's got an uh you know an extension and a pump you just put your can of paint down in the in this pump and it pumps the paint up through the roller,I bought a power roller from the Home Depot.,0

holy cow i just walked in i i didn't even i guess it's i can't believe it's over already,I'm glad I arrived before it all came to an end.,1
good grief yeah there's there's lots of pinks and greens,There are lots of colors.,0
yeah but there sure are a lot of people that work down there,There are lots of people that work there. ,2
but but do you think do you think that's why there's so many people that want to come to the United States because of freedom or,The United States isn't quite the freedom it's portrayed to be.,0
no yeah i know we had a tornado watch watch a couple of days ago but nothing really happened,"We had a tornado, but luckily nothing happened. ",0
i really don't know what the solution would be everybody  or a lot of people thought when they ended the poll tax you know many years ago that that would bring out you know a lot of voters,Ending the poll tax would make more people vote.,2
i'm not either,I am not interested.,0

um-hum well good talking to you too bye bye,Sorry but we are not done talking just yet.,1
uh because the average person doesn't get to see enough of the entire floor to see a play get uh develop develop and so uh uh i don't usually watch them i'll listen to baseball and i'll listen to uh like the Indianapolis Five Hundred i would not go and face all those crowds for anything in the world,The average person sees a ton of the whole floor.,1
because you no longer can think that fast anyway,You've lost the ability to think quickly enough.,2
do they have many buildings that have security there,Do many buildings there have security?,2
that's a good come back thank you,"Thank you, that's a good retort",2
you're at yeah you're right across the uh lake from what Plattsburgh,You are located right across the lake from Plattsburgh.,2

well um i guess i i'm more concerned about public safety than i am about the um the concern for the private uh the idea of preserving privacy for the individual um because i can't really see why anyone,Public safety is a large priority for me. ,2
i thought well with you know if that's really true then then i guess i agreed with the extra premium,"Even if it's true, I would never agree with an extra premium.",1
uh-huh oh that'd be good um-hum um is that what this target is what you're,Is that what this target is?,2
i mean it's not very many miles from our house at all,It's very far from our house and would take us days to get there.,1
Lambert Ham and uh Stallworth and Swan,Lambert Ham and Stallworth and Swan were picked.,0
i mean you can ask and you can wheel and deal but it's not as open as it it should be it's a great idea hell i'd love to cut ours in half but uh man,"""I love the idea and you can bargain, but it's not very accessible.""",2

that does sound like fun well i've gotten some good ideas from you,"I have some ideas for you, although that does sound quite fun.",2
it was it was the strangest i'm i'm not sure it was gerrymandered but the way they drew these little patterns and stuff i i i guess i'm a little cynical of the of the power base i i i and i don't quite understand why the power base uh doesn't uh why they don't go with fourteen one i you know i and you know the it seems to me that what happened in the in the election that a lot of the people they said particularly the the uh i think it's Hispanics don't vote because they don't think that they have any affect and it's i i guess i am disappointed with Dallas in that uh the fourteen one it,"i'm not certain whether it was gerrymandered, but the way they divided the state is awfully suspicious",0
that makes my foot how'd you do that in aerobics,What method did you use to be able to do that in aerobics?,2

you know question,inquiry,2
they um you know they're testing that they're you know thinking of doing that and i think that'd be a great idea because you i think they do come become less aware and they just i don't know they and they don't hear as well for one thing and that doesn't help,They're not aware of the fact that they're all bisexual and into each other.,0
you know during the the time because we've got a thirty day grace period on the credit card as long as you pay it you know within that time and that's usually enough time for the insurance to get back,It's a good idea to pay a credit card within the 30-day grace period.,2
drug rehab and they'll send you to it so if they did have a problem they can get over it i agree with that,They definitely won't have a problem with it.,1
oh don't say that,You shouldn't say that about yourself.,0
uh-huh so i think it just i think it depends on the circumstances and how many times that person has been in trouble i mean really big trouble,"I do not think the circumstances matter, a crime is a crime.",1
as far as you know paying off the the the loan that you just got from the credit card to pay off the other loan,You got a loan to buy a new laptop.,1

or Texas no that's not a good idea,"I wish I could get behind Texas, but there's just so much regulation there.",0
they they just started trying to get them together like like like like that around here from for from the community because uh we had a big ice storm uh very very recently you don't sound like you're in the north you sound like you're in the south somewhere,We never had an ice storm.,1
well we get the same things trees being uprooted limbs falling all over the place power lines getting torn completely off the poles being completely pulled out of the ground,Many levels of destruction are caused by winds and storms in our area.,2
but completely unelectable and,Not at all electable.,2
and a pool to go to that would be nice,It would be nice to have a pool that is free and open to the public.,0
yes well you know it interesting they have a new one out have you ever watched Expose Expose,"Have you ever watched that show, I watch it every week.",0
i'm not saying they're all bad but i think people who are guilty of really serious heinous crimes do not deserve to be cared for for the rest of their lives,I believe that people who have committed seriously heinous crimes should get the death penalty.,0
yeah are you here in local Texas i mean,I mean that you live in Texas.,0
well how about you do you use PCs,Do you use PCs at your job?,0
yeah oh you can look in if you pretty if you look at the region and and on to their detriment they came from uh this uh hundreds of years of Spanish control in the in the Spaniards have a horrible history of corrupt uh government greedy uh rulers who uh have been uh i don't know manipulating manipulating their public for their own their own good i mean if you go back to the kings and then the the conquistadors coming in and and the whole the incredibly horrible things they did to the uh the native tribes i mean they make uh they make the things that Custer did look like uh like trivial and uh you get,What we did to Natives makes Custer look like Citizen of the Year.,0
yeah lot of pop music out that just isn't very thrilling,Pop music isn't my type of music to start with. ,0
um she asked if i i guess they went ahead and told you we're supposed to be talking about uh drug testing and what do we think about the policy of most companies and government agencies and of course that's something we're familiar with,She asked if the drug tested all employees.,0
yeah and they're they're still they can provide for society whereas some of them are so far gone that they can't do anything good for society,Some of the people can't do anything to help society. ,2
i think i dislike the phone number part the worst i mean it's it's one thing to get junk mail because you can you can just put it right in the trash but it's the phone calls and you know usually when they call you it's going to be when you sit right when you sit down to dinner because they know they pretty much know that you're at work all day and they call you right when when you've just gotten home from work the last thing you want is a phone call unless it's you know something halfway enjoyable but if it's a salesperson it's just something you don't want to have to mess with and and i've gotten a lot of them lately or i'll sometimes i come home from work and there's a lot of hang ups on my answering machine and i'm just assuming it's probably a salesman that called during the day and i wasn't home and they'll probably call me up and you know call me back and bother me when i sit down to dinner later on but,I don't have a home telephone so I don't know anything about unwanted sales calls.,1
is it pottery or is it wood,"Which is it, pottery or wood?",2
but from what i heard the guy who got it was better so i you know i can see that but oh,I can watch it since I heard that the guy who got it was better.,2
yeah i would agree with that i think you're right i think they sometimes get carried away by the circumstances and make huge settlements thinking well it's only going to cost the insurance company and,I think they allow themselves to get carried away because they think it only costs the insurance company.,2
that's that's most of it and he plays very heavily on the race issue,He has never used race at any time.,1
oh uh-huh well uh i bought a motor home here four four years ago and i have been living in it ever since and i'm looking forward to just traveling,"I bought a motor-home, and sold it after a few months.",1
you're kidding oh that's interesting,That's boring man,1
uh-huh um-hum yeah right,"No, not at all.",1
yeah it it's going to leak into our water and then we're going to have problems with our water and then it's going to cause health problems and so there is a long-term,There are going to be a lot of long-term repercussions.,0
to socialize not really to learn and the parents send them there because they're supposed to and plus it gets them out of their hair and i also find that,The parents are required to send them there to socialize.,2
uh i graduated in eighty six,I was done in eighty six.,2
i just heard something about moving recently about moving um there there there's some central command post in Tampa i think they now want to move to somewhere in the Middle East actually there was um a small country or small city i think well you know not actually in Saudi Arabia or or anything but a little bit off to the um east of it i think and i they want to keep something over there so that they don't have to um i guess it's i guess it's so that so they don't have to move troops out so quickly or something i'm not quite sure exactly why they want to do it but they want to keep some sort of central command post there,I've heard that they're removing a command post in the Middle East and moving it to Florida.,1
yeah yeah what was your degree in,Don't tell me what field you have your degree in.,1
well the but uh something need does need to be done about the styrofoam,The styrofoam needs to be stored in a proper fashion.,0
you can have the car uh uh checked at uh an independent service station and have them go through it from top to bottom and tell you if they can find anything wrong because they don't have any financial interest in it,Independent service stations have a vested interest in not checking your car properly.,1
i thought that was disgusting i mean,I felt like that was revolting.,2
i don't know sometimes i think they should even check the the music you know the entertainment,You can never go wrong with picking good music.,0
and i had the i think the other thing that a lot of kids would benefit from in high school is taking an aptitude test,I think having an aptitude test in for kids in high school would be helpful.,2
um-hum well uh uh most of my friends do spend a lot of time down in Florida but uh i have just that's just not been my thing we used to always head west or head north now that i'm alone why uh i uh prefer to travel overseas if i'm going anywhere,Most of my friends spend a lot of time in Florida but I think it's so trashy.,0

well i mean how can you contrast the the Europeans and their vocalism on their rights to to say the people in Latin America i mean why are they why are they not as vocal or why do they not you know stand up so to speak for their rights,"Why do Europeans fight for their rights, but Latin Americans stay quiet?",2

that's interesting i almost lost our electricity here,i nearly lost our electricity because I forgot to pay the bill,0
uh i found one thing that it's kind of a weird thing to say to put out in the lawn but every time i've done it it's got it it drives the fleas completely out of the area,It doesn't help getting the fleas out.,1
because by the vanilla doesn't seem to thicken as well as the sometimes the cocoa is like my husband really likes it thick he says i can stick the spoon right in this,I prefer my cocoa with vanilla in it.,0
that was just the rule and if they saw us watching something they'd say all right what did you see on What's New or there was some other the children's program i think at the time was called What's New so we had to give a little oral report before we could,They would let us watch any show without question,1
uh well i was going to talk to you about that eighty six team  that was that was the year that uh they beat Houston in uh extra innings right,The team beat Houston in extra innings that year and I was there!,0
i mean morals isn't something that's just in your heart and you're born with it you're,All morals have to be learned through experience.,1
yeah i'm not certain either but you're probably right,"I am pretty certain, and you are actually wrong.",1
