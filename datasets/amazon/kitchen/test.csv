0,i spent several hours searching researching rice cookers trying to find one that was designed specifically for brown rice i finally decided on this one because it specifically mentioned brown rice and had brown rice measurements '' which are different than for regular white rice i am disappointed first of all the manual recommends not using the keep warm '' function when using brown rice this means you have to unplug the machine when the cooking cycle is over this defeats the purpose of an automatic rice cooker but even this drawback might be acceptable if it did a good job of cooking brown rice properly it does not it is either too wet mushy or too dry and burnt we have been unable to cook a proper batch yet after much experimentation with slightly more or less water and using 3 different types of brown rice look elsewhere and let me know if you find one that works properly with brown rice,0
1,i picked this up on a special promotion for 20 and for that price it is unbeatable has held up for years of regular use dishwasher cleaning be sure to get some soft spatulas with your first pan purchase,1
2,i bought this set and was very pleased until the grater just snapped at the handle this implies that there is a support problem with the manufacturers design,0
3,i dont think it was as bad as the reviews imply i 've had mine about 6 months now and it still works fine the only complaint i have is about the settings as one person said it can be the exact same on both sides and yet one side will burn '' and one be underdone '' i just adjusted these and turned them so they both cook whatever i 'm making right even though it is off by one number compared to the other side so thats a fluke for sure which would make it worth buying one without any problems but frankly i 've yet to find such a toaster other then that i 've had no problems with this one i love the look and style of it as well it is so cute and practical other then the above problem i would recommend this toaster but as i got it as a gift i probably wouldnt spend the 50 but would gladly pay 30 for it i dont think you can really find a better toaster i 've done the cheap kmart specials and frankly those dont last as long as this has without much worse problems or burning,1
4,used this burner during a kitchen renovation does n't heat very evenly for use with a skillet but product is sufficient for boiling water for pasta and vegetables wish the base was heavier for stability,0
5,i received this a shower gift a few years ago standard mixer ca n't do anything too drastic with it but i noticed the last time i took the beaters out of the dishwasher they had rusted these are not stainless beaters and they will rust i 'm in the market for a new mixer,0
6,i have owned my fair share of indoor grills from a foreman grill to a really heavy grill pan which i ordered through amazon not too long ago i recently acquired the calphalon grill pan because my foreman grill is too small if i want to cook a piece of meat and some vegetables at the same time plus the black coating on my foreman grill is wearing out so i bought the calphalon grill pan when it was on sale at a local department store i have n't been able to get enough of it it is so easy to clean even when i had cooked a piece of meat that was marinated in italian dressing or in my own concoction of ground fennel seed garlic shallots and extra virgin olive oil the marinade will of course stick to the grill which is expected however cleaning it off the grill pan was so much easier than my last grill pan which was heavy and difficult to clean because it was n't i also like using the calphalon grill pan because i can cook both the meat and vegetable say asparagus at the same time the results are fabulous i get those wonderful grill marks and grill taste although it is a bit big for this apartment dweller i still consider this grill pan the best of all the indoor grills i have owned well worth the money too,1
7,this product stands up to heavy use without fraying or melting my only complaint and it 's a significant one is the shape of the handle i find it awkward and clunky it 's probably great for people with larger hands i 've decided to replace mine with cheaper ones,0
8,my got me one of these when i started feeding my first son baby food before i would just mash up our food with a fork this is much easier i 've had it for three years now and it 's still working great i use it for everything now my husband does n't like veggies and i when i cook i usually put onion celery and bell pepper in everything now we get the taste of my beloved vegtables and he does n't have to deal with the chunks great product !,1
9,we had registered for pans for our wedding last year and decided to go with a calphalon commercial nonstick set instead the person helping us highly recommended the calphalon one infused anodized set instead and said the demonstrations he had seen were fantastic we bought that set and have had it for nearly a year we hardly ever use it however because things stick so badly even with oil while the set looks quite nice and cleans up easily enough with soaking and bar keeper 's friend i 'm very disappointed with how it cooks and would love to be able to return it,0
10,the diadem cooking set roughly meets the wmf criteria though there are slight imperfections on the metal and the top the products are made im china at first i thought something was wrong then i looked at the wmf site and indeed they have a factury in china so they must be genuine however i think amazon should clearly state if they are made in china or germany i ordered another wmf kettle last week made in germany and i think there is a differenc,1
11,nice shiny new heavy quality product two uses later warped and buckled tray bottom shiny heavy product i am a keen cook and i do n't expect to spend this much on an quality '' item only for it to warp and buckle after two uses under normal conditions 1 star,0
12,these sheets are not quality they are no way equal to the value that the seller has assigned to them the jersey material is very thin and the construction technique is inferior they are not a bargain,0
13,they do what they hold themselves out to do and considering how hard its been finding these items who can complain,1
14,we have had this dinnerware for several years it really is beautiful however it chips quite easily or maybe we are just a bit rough with 4 kids ! and so i find i have to buy some new ones each year so i have enough unchipped plates when company comes,1
15,purchased the toaster as a gift for my daughter 's family they love it with 2 kids and friends the large capacity sleek design and perfect toasted bagels keeps everyone happy get lots of positive comments from friends on how it looks and toasts !,1
16,this timer screams quality ! lovely and a great shriek to it you 'll def hear it while in another part of the house ! one of its best features is that you can set the time just by tapping the particular numbers of the time needed the best timer i 've ever used or seen i got two ! SMILE,1
17,we were more than pleased with our purchase of this item and it arrived sooner than expected it was very very nice and well worth the great discounted price we received it for,1
18,the breville chiller works so so based on the 6 minute claim the company states to get it cold like in your refrigerator it took more like minutes still faster than a fridge though also the description is sort of deceptive since it says new freezer gel packs no messy ice '' i thought you just use these freezer packs and thats it note you still need access to a freezer to freeze the gel packs before using also you still need to add water and the freezer packs do n't really last that long if you want to chill more than 1 bottle i ended having to use good old ice cubes since the freezer packs were spent its a bit messy trying to chill anything other than wine bottles since a typical drink will be submerged under the water bath and the only way to retrieve it is to dunk your hand in the cold water also if you are chilling allot of beverages there is no way to pour out the excess water as the ice melts they should put a drain spout at the bottom i had to unplug the unit and dump the excess water over the sink it does work being faster than your fridge or freezer but the companies performance claims are a bit exaggerated,0
19,very noisy and takes too long to brew boxed it up to return but i misplaced the packing slip will keep using mom 's very old corelle electric percolator,0
20,this is the best french oven i have ever used it cooks evenly and cleans easily while it is very heavy that must add to the excellence of its cooking and that 's what i wanted no complaints 5 stars,1
21,i ordered 2 sets of four in case there was any breakage and guess what 1 ramekin was broken leaving me with 7 dishes to top it off a few days later i found a comparable set slightly larger at big lots for only 7 for four of course this is always the risk we take through mail order often it is not worth the time or trouble to get refunds or replacements,0
22,this pan is a pure junk there are already a couple of reviews and the people recognize that this is not a surface this is true to the very end i mean everything sticks like hell so if it sticks why not buy a stainless steel pan instead all this polymer invention is complete ! ! ! it does n't do anything ! i am returning this and i 'll get a 1 nonstick calphalon from amazon,0
23,warped badly upon receipt too much of a pain to return it it is already in the tras,0
24,my son who is a culinary graduate purchased a set of oxo knives for me as a gift i know they were not inexpensive however within a year three of the six knives seperated from the grips during use while the grips are quite nice the knives are dangerous to use and can cause serious injury in the kitchen they should be removed from the market in all three cases the blades flipped upwards during slicing,0
25,this is one great tool i have this as well as the scoop and they are both great items i like the spade better since i love ice cream and it makes it easier to fill the bowl quicker the style is great and the functionality is superb now that kitchenaid is making tools and gadgets i am finding myself getting all new sorts of items i never knew i wanted or needed i 'm even replacing other brands of tools with kitchenaid ones,1
26,disappointed with the size of product have not used it yet,0
27,i like the two short handles versus the one big handle on other boilers this is a little less obtrusive on the stovetop that the one handle design it would not work well for sauces or other tasks where you need your other hand to wisk or stir works great on the flat top range and cleans up nicely highly recommend but it seems to be out of stock often,1
28,i love to bake i really love to bake bread my specialty is sourdough so now i have 3 strikes against me that is until i found la cloche although it can be used to cook meats i personally only use it for bread la cloche turns your regular oven into a brick oven and the quality of your bread will amaze you it browns beautifully has a crispy chewy crust that seems to carmelize the sugars in the crust differently there is no need to spray water or create steam in the oven because the steam is created inside la cloche by the bread itself so actually bread making is more simple and safe because you are not spraying water into a 500 degree oven there are 2 shapes a french bread style and round oven hearth style i have both and pop them into the oven at the same time so i am baking 2 loaves of bread at once which is a little more economical truly i wish i had this from the beginning of my baking attempts if you are a baker or love one go ahead and spring for it you will never regret this kitchen tool all my other bread pans are now unused,1
29,i just received my jiffy steamer it was missing a funnel which would be no big deal if they had not printed the words use enclosed funnel '' in caps every where i sent an email and they said they will send me one they seem to have a good customer service now that we have dispensed with the whining lets talk about the product itself if you need sharp lines on your pants or shirt stick with your iron this is not for you however if you would like to take wrinkles out of your clothes and you do n't want to bother with hanging them in the bathroom while you take a shower or taking them out of the dryer on time this does do an amazing job i have also purchased a jiffy personal hand held steamer that works fairly well and provides adequate amount of steam for most of your needs however if you take wrinkles out frequently and have the space go for you get the wrinkles out faster if you have a concern about startup time you do have some control over that i just put enough cold water in there for a few shirts and it started steaming in 4 minutes if you put hot water out of the tab and reduce the amount of water you can get even quicker startup time or you can put it on standby in the morning before you go to the shower and put it on steam when you are ready to use it standby setting uses a thermostat to keeps the water temperature at degrees close to boiling if you can afford it buy one it would make a great item if you find out that you do n't like it,1
30,if you prep a lot of fruits and vegetables in your kitchen this is the set for you the santoku knife is lighter than a standard chef 's knife but this is what makes it so wonderful on fruits and vegetables i have used it to carve prime rib just to see how if worked and it performed just as well as my chef 's knife except that it is a little smaller i find that i use the santoku 90 of the time in my kitchen if you are diminutive female this knife feels right in the hand since it is a little smaller than a standard chef 's knife i love the blade on this knife it holds an edge much longer than my knives the paring knife is nothing special but it does have the same nice hard blade that is on the santoku you will not be disappointed in this purchase if you love to cook,1
31,this pan is nicely made and is fairly thick silicone but when full it is floppy and does n't hold its shape on the sides the cake i made turned out with bulges on the sides that i had to trim off to make it a nice neat rectangle i understand now why some more expensive silicone pans have wire sleds '' to support the pans,1
32,based on the other reviews posted i purchased this board and am extremely pleased with it it 's nice and big for rolling out all kinds of doughs you may have to make room in your cabinet to store it if you do n't want it on your counter all the time but it is worth the trouble also it washes up nicely,1
33,i love the way cast iron cooks not to mention it is so nice to spend less on something that lasts longer and is easier to clean up ! i do have problems lifting things sometimes but this is about the same amount of work as the pans that i used to have although slightly heavier the handles are ergonomic and the loop on the other side of the handle compensates by making a balanced lifting motion easier,1
34,this citrus juicer has a very good external design the problem is that is not enough power for doing the job well normal orange presure stops de motor ! the transmission of the power is done by cheap plasic parts so they broke easily these parts broke after a dozen of uses in my case so i do not recommend this machine,0
35,these cup are enormous ! not to mention beautiful in that fun and elegant way that only fiestaware can be i was looking for a very large oversized mug because i drink a lot of coffee and tea and am sick of having to refill constantly i definately got my wish i have eaten soup and cereal out of these i even used them to serve coffee ice cream recently very cute ! i plan on getting them in all of the six colors i have in fiestaware let me tell you again this cup is huge,1
36,this is not a very good hot tea brewer the tea does n't steep hardly at all and there is no difference between the strength settings the water is also not heated to boiling it is really just a glorified coffee maker you would be better off purchasing a more traditional teapot for far less money,0
37,hi i usually do n't complain about the products that i buy because i consider myself a savvy consumer but in this instance i was dubbed big time ! a few years ago we received a krups coffee maker as a wedding gift and we love it ! however this particular toaster rarely worked in fact i would say that 85 time it would either not toast or would flip '' the toast prematurely 5 second or less i have no idea if this is a fluck in quality control or not but i highly recommend buying a different toaster i know i thought krups makes a toaster wow i 'll buy it after all how hard can it be for a german company to manufacture functional a toaster well evidently they have issues,0
38,discount any review of a blender that reflects only several months of use as a smoothie addict shoveling a dozen or more ice cubes into the jar daily i 'm still looking for a machine that can go the distance is a full year 's use asking too much the braun burned out in the first 90 days faster than my black and decker oster even hamilton beach though it lasted longer than back to the basics the best thing i can say for the braun is that it does n't have the push buttons always look for a single switch a knob or a otherwise their shavers have served me better mowing down whiskers more dependably than ice cubes i 'm going back to the beginning and giving the classic oster another try though i 'm beginning to feel guilty about cluttering the landfills with more broken machinery and useless glass jars,0
39,a very solid knife set especially with the extra slots for those who have a few favorite '' knifes left in the drawer make sure when you buy henckels to get the twin '' set instead of the single little that 's a big upgrade in quality oh and for goodness sake people quit putting your knife set through the dishwasher and just clean them as you go,1
40,this is my first le creuset casserole when i first received it it was smaller than i was expecting but after cooking with it couple times i really fall in love with it ! now i always clean it after using and have it on my stove top in the kitchen ! it 's so cute and fun,1
41,unfortunately i ordered these twice and received rectangular bakers instead this was amazon 's fault but emile henry 's for mislabling the box as oval bakers when they were not in fairness to amazon they tried to make it right but had a difficult time doing so since the contents of the box were mislabled althought i would have preferred the oval bakers i kept the rectangular ones and do like them,0
42,henkel pro s knives are second to none they will last a lifetime and make a tremendous difference in your cooking these knives take the 'chore ' out of cutting vegis,1
43,the dishes came quickly and were in perfect condition the introductory offer of an credit card allowed me to get a 40 discount and i 've been using it since for the reward points great doing business with you,1
44,unit is advertised as 5 quart what arrived is 2 quart and much too small for my purposes,0
45,great for frying eggs but i prefer a pan with higher sides for omlets every grilled sandwich i 've made on this griddle has come out perfect my kids use it to make pancakes and they swear by it i 've found that the griddle in the oven first helps it heat more evenly and avoid the hot spots that can occur when cooking on a stove top the works great,1
46,i just keep buying more of these glasses including other sizes and shapes they look good and are great at keeping drinks hot or cold,1
47,i bought this grinder for flax seed and it works wonderfully what i love most is that after you grind what you need you can place the tight sealing lid that comes with it on and put in right into the fridge nice look great function and very clean machine,1
48,i knew going in that these were not thick '' but i am pleased with these sheets would i buy them again yes aslong as the price is as low as i got them for under 20 bucks,1
49,this was supposed to be the toaster to end all toasters we had it for about 2.5 years and now the toast brown on only one side the outer heating elements still work the inner elements work at about capacity of the outer ones we now turn our toast around after a couple minutes to cook the other side until we find the next toaster to end all toasters this one was not it !,0
50,every time i use the pan is twists as soon as it gets hot it makes it very difficult to cook on and to move in and out of the oven the non stick surface comes off very easily too for the money i expected better ! !,0
51,you can depend upon pyrex to give you a great product use this cup for measuring all the time,1
52,i brought pans from my local sam 's club wearhouse and initially the pans worked great this is my review after about 1.5 years of use 1. the handle on the lid plastic broke after about a year 2. the non stick coating began to crack from regular use in about about 6 month and it got so bad that i tossed the pan out in about a year and half 3. the handle broke twice on me and for both time i super glued them back on on the third time i just tossed them out and got an expensive anolon titanium set 4. the pan is not made of aluminum and there are hot cold '' spots on the pan the hot cold spot is caused by uneven distribution of heat a good pan generally with copper or aluminum core will evenly distribute heat this pan does not bottom line do not use this pan in the oven eventhough the instruction said up to 400 degrees the handle will and did crack on me for 3 times with occasional oven use the pan is thin and does not distribute heat well and the worst the coating is a joke i found out that it 's actually cheaper to get a expensive set and use it for like 10 years instead of getting a cheap set for a third of the price and replace it every 2 years or less not recommended,0
53,the petstep ii dog sately ramp was perfect for getting my black lab blake out of the water and over our sea wall he is over 90 pounds and it was sturdy and supported his weight he is very appreciative and so am i ! i would highly recommend this product and the seller selling it,1
54,i have recived serveral comments on how good these knifes look i am in fact very pleased with the way they look but even more important is how well they perform they cut wonderfully for me at least but i 'm used to cheapy knifes yes they will in fact rust although i have n't had this problem with my set had them for about four months now because i only handwash them and dry them immediately one steak knife found it 's way into the dishwasher and sure enough it came out with a little rust spot this was easily removed with a little steel wool you just have to weight the benefits of the all metal knifes to those that are wood handled or plastic,1
55,i was really looking forward to receiving this but four weeks after purchasing online i received an email from amazon saying they did not have a supplier for my purchase ! i am disappointed in amazon how can you sell something you do not have,0
56,i was so looking forward to this machine i am a long time machine bread maker and have had two other brands with not a problem first yes it burns the crust on med second i made 4 count them four batches of their recipe bread and my recipe bread and they were all awful could not believe it each time i followed the reciped and instructions to the letter i 'm giving up the ghost and going back to my el cheapo bread machines that work every time love the style and the loaf shape of the cuisinart but do n't like wasting my time and ingredients maybe i got a lemon,0
57,does n't work not worth the postage to return the foil cutter works though so if you want a really expensive foil cutter with a free paper weight this is for you !,0
58,to be fair the design is great looking size is ideal and very functional however beware of quality and packaging whoever packaged this in thailand did not take care it has nicks and scratches to mention the dings in corners paint in all the panels is you can see different colorations throughout different panels it is somewhat redish in stain tone could be darker to be a true dark walnut manufacturing flaws such as missing drill holes which makes it tough when assembling got screws just missing screw holes i only recommend to those with a nack of wood handyman not for the average person recommend you need the following tools drill with phillips screw heads and drill bits just in case small bottle of dark wood stain to touch up painting the scratches and some patience to continue beware when placing this table on a true flat surface it may have uneven stance ok on carpeting and beware if displaying in bright lit areas people may see the different paint tones and difference between the two table lasting it is not 100 solid wood some panels have veneer over particle board heck what do you expect for,0
59,i bought two sets of four bowls to complement my nice set of everyday dishes for times when you want just a little bit of something a little yogurt or some granola some fresh raspberries we use them all the time i agree with a previous reviewer that they would be wonderful for food prep they are not thin as a previous reviewer has noted they are not thick or bulky either though just perfect they seem like they will last a long time and wear quite well they almost look well elegant which seems kind of cool for just pyrex and for the price the bowls come and although the price is very low they definitely do n't seem cheaply made i have n't seen them in stores either great buy !,1
60,box arrived damaged opened product scratched on front dirty on the inside after i cleaned it up it worked great for a week then poof '' no power at all thought i may have ran it too much so i left it unplugged for 24 hours then plugged it back in and nothing additionally customer service for edgestar is terrible i have left 10 voicemails and sent approx 14 back and forth with their customer service haha reps and still have made zero progress buy with caution,0
61,hey not to be too redundant but this really is a good can opener i have no problems with it my wife who always has problems with can openers has some '' problems sometimes '' using it but as she never could get any of the others to ever work this is a big improvement the knife sharpener is an okay touch however if you have good knives i would n't use it i sharpen by hand with an edge pro '' but hey it 's a can opener it will sharpen a knife i just would n't put my 100 schaaf golden hamster '' through maybe my chicago for a quick fix,1
62,i returned three incantos all for the same reason the steamer stopped working on all of them after weeks it sounded like the pump failed i replaced it with the slightly more expensive older magic comfort plus which has worked like a charm,0
63,the black decker arctic twister ice cream mixer is a product that you must not purchase it is a total waste of money it 's designed to make ice cream at home the are not enpough pro 's and way too many cons the only pro it makes ice cream when ever you want cons 1. it 's loud and noisy 2. the ice cream you use in it must be as frozen as it is the second it comes out of the freezer which makes it very hard to scoop out 3. if not used correctly it make a huge mess 4. it wastes ice cream when you use this product half of the ice cream gets stuck inside the machine 5. by the time its finished ice cream is pratically melted 6. you ongly get about of what you put in the machine the rest gets stuck inside the machine 7. you have to hold onto the on switch while operating the machine 8. you have to hand pump the ice cream into yourself this black decker arctic twister ice cream mixer is such a waste of money i so reccomend not buying this just going to dairy queen or baskin robins is a much easier and cleaner solutio,0
64,i have owned this blender for two years now and will have to replace it due to one of the plastic mixer pieces snapping off causing it to continually leak unfortunately it appears that i have to buy a whole new unit instead of just the pitcher portion overall there were definitely questions of durability over the years as small pieces broke off one by one but it did tend to blend things as a blender alone it was not the most effective blender i have ever seen but neither was it the worst it was truly mediocre through and through as a smoothie maker the mechanism used for the pour spout did n't allow any chunks to pass through and it never quite seemed to blend well enough to break up those chunks so as a smoothie maker it was not a good choice on the good side the stainless does look nice although it was a little tall,0
65,you get what you paid for nice pattern but the bedding is somewhat rough to the touch would n't give it as a gift,0
66,i have and do use many different fillet knives but needed one for knife block in the kitchen it had to match my other 4 stars it not only matched but the construction if great and is an excellent performer,1
67,fyi those of you with square burners will not like this one it is not stable because of the design which is clearly meant for round burners,0
68,when i was searching for something to simplify my life i came upon this product i thought i would give it a try as i love egg mcmuffins it is everything i dreamed of and more easy convient done in less than five minutes and a breeze to clean up i love it and ca n't stop telling family and friends about it i hope you enjoy it as much as i have,1
69,the holes are really small this grater is suitable for hard cheeses like romano but forget using it for a softer cheese like cheddar,0
70,this product did not even approach what was described a bagutte pan needs to have a curvature so a bagutte shape will be obtained this pan would have produced a fairly flat loaf,0
71,excellent product for the value i was hesitant to purchase china via internet or mail but the china arrived in perfect condition and is beautiful and timeless thank you,1
72,i ordered this thinking that i 'd save a bundle and have a really nice comforter set not ! the product description promised navy and sage but it is black and sage it is the cheapest looking comforter that i have ever seen i sent mine back yesterday i just ca n't let the seller get away with the totally inaccurate description and the deception in claiming that this product was originally dollars,0
73,i felt disapointed with the quality of this bake set the grill cover started to desapair and the last time i cooked a stek using this set the paint sticked to the meat leaving black spots it started to show deteriorazion and everytime i washed i have to dried it up immediately otherwise mark of rust starts to show soon the deep pan it is ok perhaps because i did not used that piece with the same frequency i never used metal utensills or harsh detergents durig the cleaning i always leave it in hot water first and later do the cleaning to avoid scratches thank you for your attention nilda,0
74,farberware stainless steel cookware is a good line i had this cookware at one time and i can recommend it especially for use on gas burners unlike calphalon cookware it can go in the dishwasher however to keep the finish gleaming you might need to scrub the pots and pans frequently with cleanser and scouring pads the stockpot with lid is a kitchen essential,1
75,this is an extremely nice cutting board great size and easy to handle cleans up in a breeze no stains and does not dull those favorite knives i have the larger size but this one is my favorite,1
76,i bought one of your pans and i was so very careful with it only using plastic or wood utensils the pan has got big bubbles in it and the nonstick finish is pealing off i rate this very poor,0
77,i bought this egg cooker as a gift for my son but i have used it and really like it it soft boiled the eggs perfectly and is also very convenient to clean the timer is also loud enough to hear,1
78,i bought this timer because my husband wanted one similar to the one his mom had with the big display and the simple operation this particular timer was better priced than most i looked at and i liked the extra large display i have been very happy with it the buttons do n't stick like other timers i have used i like the way the memory feature works and the bonus feature that it can count up is also nice,1
79,i bought this pan as a christmas gift for my husband it would have been easier if i had just put a match to my money and burned it he has given up using this pan he even read the directions thinking he was doing something wrong every egg he placed in it stuck to the side of the teflon rings what a shame the only use would be to throw the rings away and just use it as a regular pan do n't waste your money,0
80,i love this fryer ! its just the right size for my not big and bulky like other fryers its easy to clean too its a winner in my book,1
81,in my opinion this is the best kitchen timer out there ! it has four separate programmable digital timers that can count up down each with their own alarm sound it also has a regular clock setting plus you can either plop it on the fume hood using the magnet on the back of it clip it to your apron using the clip or set it on the counter using it 's support stand oh and did i mention how small it is just another nice feature ! so yeah no more having to set the oven timer the microwave timer and my watch timer in order to keep track of all the various foods cooking at the same time not only do i use this timer in the kitchen constantly i also use it for numerous other things too it 's the time out '' timer for the kids a reminder when i need to get us all out of the house you name it ! my mother owns this same timer and is the one that originally introduced me to it thank heavens ! i ca n't imagine running a kitchen without this hard to find item if you check out bed bath beyond you 'll see they do n't have anything with four programmable timers long story short if you purchase this timer i promise you will not be disappointed,1
82,a normal coffee maker requires a quick rinse this machine requires a wash rinse and a thorough drying of the grinding unit you ca n't just rinse the grinding unit because the fine coffee grounds need to be washed out if it was n't for the fact that we spent nearly 100 for this unit i would throw it away save your money do n't buy it,0
83,i love the way the tefal deep fryer cooks however i am returning my second one due to a defective lid closure the lid may close initially but after a few uses it no longer stays closed since i have small children in my home i will not be purchasing this one again,0
84,i returned it without even using it because it did not feel like a quaility item i would not recomend this product if you have any taste,0
85,i ordered this cake plate and dome for my mother shortly before thanksgiving of 2002. the first time it arrived after 3 weeks it was in about pieces the ups driver realized that upon delivery and returned the item when it was sent the second time which was n't until around christmas it arrived with the handle to the dome broken off so long story short no cake plate for mom ! should really examine how they pack items like this,0
86,i have had this iron for awhile now the big problem is that gunk builds up on the soleplate that is almost impossible to get off except when you iron white shirts when it seems to rub off of the collar and seams permanently staining and thus ruining your shirts avoid this iron at all costs,0
87,my wife and i have long been fans of fiestaware and we have been using many of their pieces for years somehow it was n't until about 2 years ago that we discovered this size at 9 '' the lunch plate is perfect for many occasions especially lunch ! smile the quality of these plates is very good and this size is very uselul for some reason these are seldom seen as part of a standard set we use ours all the time highly recommended !,1
88,purchased these to go with a 7 inch henckels international santoku that i 've been using for years and the phrase that comes to mind to describe all fine edge cutlery is good enough '' no it is n't restaurant quality and yes if you put these through the dishwasher they 'll tarnish and probably even start to rust any metal designated as stainless '' is rust resistant rather than rust proof and reviewers of other henckels products complaining about rust and tarnish probably are n't treating their knives very well as a graduate student on a budget who enjoys cooking but does n't always have the time for it these knives are an ideal compromise between price and quality be aware that they will occasionally require sharpening i 've had the santoku for almost three years and run it through a commercially available ceramic disk sharpener every few months and it still cuts very nicely and should probably be for longest life with that little bit of maintenance however this three piece set can meet nearly all of your cooking needs it meets all of mine but then i do n't often dress poultry filet my own fish or do much that would require a cleaver or really subtle boning knife for quite a nice price,1
89,i tried to chill my white wine in seven minutes and it was still warm they say chill but what does that really mean they should say what temperature it chills to in 7 minutes i guess that is why they have a 15 minute timer also the description does not state that you have to add water so it is just as messy as an ice bucket and as much work,0
90,very disappointing ! spend your money somewhere else i threw away a perfectly good but old made in the usa thermos bottle and bought this made in china nissan insulated bottle back in june of 2005. ten months later this bottle stopped keeping anything warm and would feel warm to the touch after you poured warm liquids in it evidence of the loss of its insulating function i think it lost the vacuum in the cavity which i think is the method used to insulate the liquid inside when you spend 25 one would think it 's a good quality product think again,0
91,i bought this and some other pans in the set very disappointed i have a glass cooktop and when the pans heat up they warp then return to their normal shape when they cool down guess i got what i paid for,0
92,right out of the box and with skim milk i have a latte that rivals the corner coffee bar easy to set up easy to use easy to clean can i ask for more what else is there,1
93,i have seen this set at my friends place gorgeous ! ! a bid pricy though compared to other corelle sets,1
94,given as a gift same story the fact that i primarily used high heat it did n't last past 6 months said too bad after i emailed them and called them several times leaving messages took them 3 months to get back to me and then that was it i will never buy ever again ! !,0
95,the item was not what i expected the description said metal but it should have said tin '',0
96,i like these lid covers as they fit very well i have always had a hard time with plastic wrap sticking or aluminum foil tearing i would recommend this if you need to store your recipes for a bit before serving them i also like the sturdiness of these lids as it does not allow flavors to mix when you put them in the refrigerator,1
97,my salter 1001 scale started having problems within 3 months and broke within 10 months i am sending the scale back to saltier for replacement a good scale while it worked but what pain this has become,0
98,the salesclerk told us that because of previous model recalls that the new kitchenaid was sure to be a huge improvement especially with it 's price tag we 've tried 2 models and both had problems with error messages the manual 's suggestions do nothing to eliminate this also we 've had the same trouble with coffee spewing out for the price tag this is a seriously disappointing coffee maker we finally took it back and are on the look out for a better quality model not kitchenaid oddly enough our other kitchenaid appliances range and fridge have also had electronic problems i wonder what the quality control is on the parts that are being cheaply manufactured no doubt in some overseas location i would n't recommend kitchenaid to anyone regardless of the nice styling and supposed,0
99,i was so excited when i found a contemporary stainless pattern to add to my gift registry when i received the 20 piece set at a shower i was very ecited until i washed them and never got to eat off them because they rust ! ! ! ! i called gourmet settings and they are sending me another set but i am removing the 45 piece set from my registry i will use them for picnic silverware not dining roon silverware,0
100,this knife has a lot to offer as far as i 'm concerned i 'm not looking for a highlife line of knives because i have a family all of which do not respect special care of important knives i want a knife that cuts sturdy and can take some abuse like being in water or not being cleaned right away i do not buy wood handles anymore either because too many times the knife goes in the water or is not cleaned promptly i also want one that will stay sanitary or can be sanitized this santuko by cuisinart fits the bill for me the weight is excellent for me i have a large hand for a woman and some health issues for which i prefere a lighter handling knife that cuts without a lot of pressure and will not make my wrist ache when used cuts like a dream through all the fruits and veggies i tried it on washed up easy and quick dried quick too i paid only a little bitty amount for this very big hearted knife i recommend it for all real cooks out there that also have family using your stuff,1
101,if you 're like myself the 5 pot of coffee has to be simple well designed makers keep it almost idiot proof this one does a great you learn that the spout is not drip proof '' you will be happy with this as a purchase,1
102,i bought the omega 8002 juicer on the recommendation of joseph mercola a holistic health md who has a popular newsletter and website we met him at a health fair tried vegetable juices including wheatgrass juice and realized that juicing was a great way to incorporate more vegetables into our diet i mean how much broccoli and salad can one person pound down in a day not so much the omega 8002 is a single gear machine that turns at a low 80 rpms a powerful slow auger that does n't heat up the food or cause the juice to foam this protects the nutritional content of the juice from degradation in addition it is multifunctional '' the juicer can also be employed to make baby food meat pate nut butter or fine ground coffee the machine is durable said to be quiet and has a guarantee sounds good so we plunked down the cash and got the omega juicer and set to work so how is it to use the omega well it 's easy to put together though there are quite a few parts and choices to make essentially the steps are 1. install the screw drive the big green plastic spiral into the plastic housing 2. pop a juicing cone a type of sieve over the screw so it sits into the housing around the screw this takes a bit of jockeying but it drops in just fine 3. screw on the end cap and nozzle 4. mount this housing onto the front of the juicer motor 5. add the food platform on top of the feed tube on the housing 6. put the two receiving pitchers underneath the housing one for the pulp one for the juice now it 's ready to start juicing 1. cut up your vegetables into strips or pieces that will fit the 1.5 inch diameter of the feed tube this means if you juice carrots those tasty large ones need to be halved or quartered lengthwise 2. turn on the motor it has a forward direction to drive the food out and a reverse setting on the toggle switch to move the food back in case of a clog i 've never needed to do this 3. push down the vegetables or other foods with the plunger which is included with the juicer the food feeds along the screw is broken up and the juice is forced through the sieve cone out the nozzle comes the pulp the juice flows out underneath nearer to the motor 4. when you are finished turn off the motor which is quite quiet nothing like a blender or vacuum cleaner more like the sound of a pasta maker or food processor for comparison dismantle the machine and wash the parts a big bottle brush is included for this very helpful 5. cleanup takes about minutes and is mainly rinsing the worse job is the sieve of the cone and even that does n't take but a moment to swab off some pulp that clings to it i do this asap as i sip my juice because letting pulp dry on the machine makes it hard to clean i then reassemble it right then and there and it 's ready to go again the omega juices kale which is a rather tough leafy dark green form of cabbage we now can do wheatgrass once we grow some or find a source of flats of it just for grins i tried the blank cone and did some meat grinding it makes a fine grind not something you 'd use for hamburger it would work for soft somewhat grainy baby food or pate i did not try making pasta how does it compare to spinning cup type models like the braun which we previously used for juicing 1. the spinning cup model braun is loud really loud this is because the cup spins at a high speed and whines as a result this is typical for the juicer sounds like a blender 2. the cup model can not juice wheatgrass the tender stalks of growing wheat or barley that have a lot of antioxidants it also ca n't do tough leafy vegetables such as kale 3. the cup model definitely does not extract as much juice from the vegetables and fruits as compared to the omega the pulp in the cup model is a wet slurry the pulp from the omega by contrast is like slightly moistened sawdust definitely drier in summary the omega juicer while pricier than the typical spinning cup models is quiet and effective it gives you the ability to juice and grind things the spinning cup ca n't handle like wheatgrass and if you want meat it extracts more juice and at the prices for produce these days especially if you buy organic produce this is an important benefit the juicer is relatively easy to clean and to assemble and use if you are really serious about drinking vegetable juice or making fresh fruit juices and baby foods i would say this is a model to strongly consider over others the performance and added functionality well repay the higher price,1
103,the timer worked great at first but in less than a month the alarm for the timer has stopped working and the magnet has fallen off i am only keeping the timer because the clock and the stopwatch are still useful,0
104,ok it 's june and you are being hit up for present after present and you are on limited funds no need to feel depressed you can give this measuring cup set and hold your head up knowing you gave something that wo n't be sneered at or find its way to the return pile by the blushing bride everyone needs these cups to do cooking from the large size for soup and broth to the small size for baking and i will confess i 've used the medium sized one as an emergency gravy boat so it does n't look quite as nice as a cut glass gravy server it works just fine i also use the glass cups for mixing batters to pour out right from the pitcher and i use them for prepping foods like stir fry when you have to have a bunch of ingredients ready to hand to dump at once into the wok,1
105,it 's just the right size for sauteing veggies and meat for one cooks evenly and requires little cleanup the preseasoning takes the guesswork out of initially readying castiron cookware for use lodge properly packaged and sent my merchandise in record time i would definitly buy from them again and recommend them to my friends,1
106,the scale i received from amazon looks the same as the picture for the soehnle vera white digital food scale '' but it 's a different model the one i received uses the lithium battery not four aas as advertised also the product manual is different the actual manual 's title is 67000 67007 '' not '' on the bottom of the scale there is a number similar to soehnle 's product numbers 812215. but i could not find such a product anywhere fortunately the maximum weight capacity of this scale is as advertised it 's actually about the unit of measure is in or increments weighing items with this scale is very easy the lcd screen has large 0.5 '' numbers it has a auto switch and a supposedly indication overall this is a very good scale and i recommend it if you 're willing to put up with purchasing a lithium battery once in a while,1
107,i did not realise how much i needed a new one till i got the new one,1
108,i had one many years ago and never had a problem good suction maybe a little loud but i do n't care i liked it so much i 'm trying to get a new one i do n't recall ever having a problem with it like other reviewers have mentioned smoking etc it worked well and cleaned well,1
109,as advertised and described in various reviews the blender is solid powerful and loud loud i have to block my ears when it 's running but i had expected that so i 'm not complaining my one complaint is that the water tight '' lid is not and if i fill it up too full liquid comes out the top i use it for fruit smoothies no ice and vegetable soups and they come out very smooth,1
110,this is a fantastic idea for teaballs sleek and stylish this set is also practical the two teaballs are and perfectly sized for a single cup of tea simply press the plunger then stir the ball around in your loose tea container lift it out of the tea and shake the excess out to level the tea let go of the plunger and the teaball closes securely the long stem on the balls allow you to take the ball out of your cup or stir the tea as it 's brewing if that 's your preference without having to lift a hot chain off of the side of your cup of hot water prior to this purchase we used a tea 'spoon ' which also shut the problem with the spoon is that to fill it with tea you have to hold it vertically in the container which means you have few options either close the spoon while the tea is still sticking out the sides and fill your cup with loose tea or try to shake the extra tea out after you pull the spoon of the container and get tea all over your counter because of these teaballs ' design they do n't share that problem the tower has one interesting feature but some shortcomings the good design is that below where each teaball hangs there is a significant 'bowl ' to catch any tea that might still be dripping this has proven to be a very handy feature the tower itself is n't very mobile however due to how the hooks hold the teaball stems it is seemingly impossible to move without one of the balls falling out also when i got mine the tower was visibly crooked and i had to bend it back straight that worked for me but was quite hard and i was worried i 'd break it oh cleanup cleanup is much easier than with the aforementioned spoon the spoon hinges so that there is little clearance at the back of the utensil for washing out these balls do n't share that problem at all the plunger gives more than adequate clearance to simply turn the ball sideways and wash it out in the sink just make sure your sink 's filter is in ! all in all i 'm pleased with the purchase it 's such a fantastic idea that a few shortcomings do n't significantly mar how well the product works,1
111,if you are planning to purchase anything from the markeplace vendor selling this item beware i purchased the delonghi mixer based on product description and customer reviews but found that it did not perform as expected it froze up kneading a batch of whole grain bread the design is beautiful and the mixer is probably good for breads but should you have any problems with it you 'll have to stay on the vendor to get any kind of response i am still waiting for a refund on the product after 2 weeks the last message i got was that it may take a bit longer '' so be sure this is what you want before you buy it returning it is not easy and charges a 60 reshelving fee on top of the shipping you 'll have to pay to send it back my markeplace experience has been very frustrating i wo n't buy through the marketplace again if or processes my refund in the next day or two i 'll feel better and will edit my review but for now buyer beware,0
112,everything sticks to these pans ! i can not get off the potato residue and i 'm probably just going to throw them away they are awkwardly heavy they do not warp but they do pop out of shape this happens when the pans are in the oven and you 'll hear a very loud scary pop just awful,0
113,all four glasses arrived broken they are not packed for shipment i have tried three times to get amazon to refund my money but i have had no luck heed the warnings,0
114,for years we have used the coffee iced tea makers and have purchased two of them this time around we chose to get the hamilton beach 40911 iced tea maker even though have n't used the feature that allows you to place loose tea in the basket for brewing we totally like the hamilton beach method of brewing tea over the coffee first of all the taste using luzianne family tea bags was superior to any tea we ever brewed using the coffee makers also one very large drawback with the coffee maker is that the basket for the bags sets inside the reservoir and maker and most every time you brew a pitcher and remove the basket you have leakage of tea down in the makers bottom which over time makes for a very ugly looking reservoir where you put your clean water to brew your next pitcher because hamilton beach placed the basket directly inside the pitcher itself there is never any tea that finds its way into the bottom of the tea maker also due to ridges in the bottom of the coffee maker it 's usually almost impossible to totally clean the pitcher and restore it back to the clean condition at the time you first used it this feature alone makes the hamilton beach a better buy over the coffee but i thought before my purchase that surely the two would make equivalent tasting tea but using both lipton and luzianne family tea bags the hamilton beach not only brews the tea faster but the taste is better on the coffee the strength of the tea is controlled by a sliding knob on the front of the maker whereas with the hamilton beach it is three rigid clicks of control on the bottom of the basket mild medium strong we usually use medium we enjoy '' being from the south and anyone that makes good sweet tea knows you sweeten it while it 's hot at the time of brewing our method is to first fill the pitcher to the line and fill the reservoir and refill the pitcher to the same water level and then add 2 to 2 cups of sugar and stir with a whisk until very well mixed once the tea is brewed you have to stir the tea again but you get perfect sweet tea if you enjoy tea even if you never considered an electric tea maker the hamilton beach will be one purchase decision you will not regret having two coffee makers before this hamilton beach i do n't see myself ever purchasing another coffee unless they make many changes to their product and even then taste is the final decision maker i highly recommend the hamilton beach model and would gladly buy it again even if it was higher priced than the coffee it 's totally worth it,1
115,this knife has a great balance in your hand good quality stainless steel easy to sharpen and clean as well as a comfy grip handle,1
116,i loved this bread machine but it broke after owning it for about three years my husband took it apart to try to fix it but could not repair it it was making bread and just turned off we could not get it to turn back on and the manual was not helpful in trying to fix such a problem we now have to replace it it worked great until it just stopped working i think a breadmaker should last longer then three years also i did need to make sure the ingredients in the corners of the pan got mixed into the dough so i could n't just program it and leave the house,0
117,this garlic press is very well made it 's got some weight to it but no too much works on the biggest cloves of garlic leaving only the skin behind well worth the money easy to clean,1
118,i bought the hot diggity dogger many years ago we are still using it ! ! my kids have made their own hot dogs for years my middle one loves it he is getting his own place now and i am going to get him one for christmas he has used it the most he loves it it is the only appliance that i have ever gotten that has truly paid for itself,1
119,made good waffles when i got it but now it burns them to a crisp there is no adjustment on it to compensate for the ageing of the internal components,0
120,i purchased this egg cooker specifically for poaching 2 eggs i used large eggs whatever combination of water and timing i tried i never got a perfectly cooked poached egg the cuisinart instruction book is confusing in its layout specifically page 5. i called cuisinart and after much back and forth it was determined the eggs i used were too large and the directions were for eggs if considering this machine be aware you might have to sacrifice the eggs you want to eat,0
121,i have a kitchenaid model heavy duty mixer and they do not fit over my 5 qt bowl i regrettably only read the editorial review and bought these covers thinking i can snap them on i use them to loosely cover my attachments now but i could have used anything for that,0
122,i bought this set and was very pleased until the grater just snapped at the handle this implies that there is a support problem with the manufacturers design,0
123,two of the basic kitchen specialty items included in one package deal ! easy grip handles stylish and quality design will assure that these items will be around in my array of often used gadgets for a long time to come,1
124,without being too heavy for a fairly weak cook to shift about easy to clean both inside and out one expects easy cleaning of interior but the stainless steel outside comes clean with nothing more than hot soapy water the thick aluminum exterior bottom spreads heat evenly i am impressed by the coating that seems impervious to ordinary wear but will reserve judgment on that point for the anniversary of my purchase,1
125,i agree with the previous reviewer that these are difficult to clean and dry i could never get mine really clean so i threw them out,0
126,i was thinking of buying parchment paper before this product caught my eyes i took a chance after reviewing others ' good reviews on it and it was a good buy i used it to bake and it 's totally it 's also very easy to clean after use if it can be used 5000 times as it claims i definitely will save a lot compared to buying parchment paper,1
127,the product i received was faulty so irobot sent me another one robots are great but i you need to make sure they work right before the warranty is over,1
128,this machine is sure to disappoint a seasoned coffee drinker coffee as in beverage made from coffee bean not a tall cup of sanka as the term is used in the us admittedly i 'm really picky about my coffee but 250 for this machine is ridiculous i 've had coffee from a 40 krups machine that is better than that made by the espressopro i use pods with this machine molinari lucaffe and miscela d'oro which guarantees consistency in other machines but does n't help with this machine here are my issues with the machine 1. the thermoblock is n't effective i have to put water in my espresso cup and pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds before making an espresso or else my coffee will be lukewarm disgusting even with high quality beans granted unless your machine has a cup warmer this is probably a good idea regardless of your machine but with this machine it is a requirement not an option if you want hot coffee second steamed milk is lukewarm on a good day the same heating problem occurs with steaming milk i called capresso and they said to check all the fittings in fact after much frustration i 'm not an idiot i finally just sealed the connections with shrink tube which leaves only two points where the connection could be weak still i ca n't get hot steam what i do get is either lukewarm liquid milk or cool overly thick foam in fact the foam is so unrefined and thick that it gives the impression that you could chew it nasty 2. the frothing mechanism is gimmicky and not effective a standard frothing wand '' is much better the mechanism on this machine is ineffective lacks true control and requires an extra step over a standard wand to clean as explained above the heat is not sufficient and the quality of foam is irregular and bad i 'm embarrassed to serve coffee from this machine to guests let alone drink it myself i just ca n't get over the heat issue nothing kills a good coffee than lack of heat this point is so important if you take a gander at the francis ! francis ! and professional machines there 's a thermometer right on the front of the machine and no it 's not purely an esthetic design issue since you can put several types of on an espresso machine like a pressure gauge the low heat generated results in really thick solid foam when i have guests i just heat milk on the stovetop and use a handfrother instead of using the espressopro 's lame mechanism second the way you adjust the foamed milk to steamed milk ratio is not effective a little gate is regulated by the user through a twisting tab it 's just not good design since the milk actually passes through the machine and is heated internally by the machine you ca n't really work '' the milk a wand offers direct control and offers immediate visual response to whether you 're getting foam or hot milk you know dried milk that collects on your steaming wand well that 's now inside your espressopro with a traditional wand you just wipe the wand with a wet rag with this machine you need to run hot water through the frothing mechanism before you do this you need to wait for the block to heat up again plus there 's so many little pieces that need to be kept clean it 's a pain what a bad design ! 3 18 bar yeah right this machine also does n't generate enough pressure to develop nice crema granted i use pods but still a certain amount of crema is expected this machine produces a thin insufficient amount of crema the lack of sufficient pressure probably has to do with the poor thermoblock i really ca n't recommend this machine for 250 just go get a krups or braun better yet spend 50 more and get an entry level gaggia or saeco with this machine you 're paying for looks and a gimmicky ineffective frothing mechanism this hunk o ' junk is now buried deep in the back of my kitchen cabinet as i truly would not feel right pawning this machine off on someone else it is now appropriately retired '' from service and i now enjoy perfect coffee every day from my saeco vienna superautomatica now that 's a machine baby,0
129,i like this place setting color but i have taken the advice of others and i use coffee filters between pieces for storage it is a great place setting,1
130,the coffee press is in actuality just 2 cups the number of ounces is not listed in the sales blurb what we wanted was 4 cups at 8 ounces each the coffee press is just a bit over 16 ounces while it says so on the lid of the box it came in the is not in the amazon listing so we returned,0
131,airbake products are horrible ! i have used the cookie sheets multiple times and i have had nothing but problems there products everything you cook and the food sticks no matter how well you grease the pans i have better luck using my old cheap bakeware than airbake buyer beware ! if you do choose to buy this brand of products grease the pans generously and cut the bake time and oven temperature,0
132,i do a lot of stir frying using one pan to do many dishes as a result i needed a pan that had quality for quick and easy cleaning and one that could take high heat from my professional stovetop when pan and oil are heated to the right temperature the interior stainless steel surface behaved as if it were nonstick the heat was evenly conducted bottom through the sides this due to the aluminium core sandwich being continuous from the bottom up the sides the sides are high enough to not have food spill out in the process of vigourous stir frying the height is also good for small item deep frying the steep sloping of the sides enabled food to rotate well falling back easily into the pan quality pans tend to be heavy all clad without exception but this size is perfectly manageable for tossing ingredients if need to it also cooks a generous portion for one to two persons all types including metal of utensils can be used with it this is a solid handsome and versatile pan with wonderful easy care and use it is a total joy to cook with and one that gives you confidence that it will last a long long time,1
133,if you want to pay over 100 you can find much better quality but for 70 less this is a fantastic value,1
134,i 've had my keurig for about two months now and absolutely love it it makes wonderful tasting coffee in 30 seconds or so it was well worth the extra money,1
135,i splurged on this pan because i was tired of the wobble '' my cheaper pans developed on my smooth glass cooktop this pan warped severely after only 4 months not any better than pans a fraction of the cost i plan on returning it for replacement and will use the new one for low temperature sauces only,0
136,it does n't break chip or even discolor but the base has a compound kick depression on the outside and protrusion on the inside this makes a very messy exit from the dishwasher and precludes removal of debris on the inside why has n't any one noticed where 's the reviews i own a dishwasher and this is a very irritating to drain the glass dry again and place in my ! do n't buy it unless you have maids and butlers the again do n't buy it because they 'll get miffed too !,0
137,we have a full line of fiesta dishware and thought having the matching flatware would be nice after a year of standard use and dishwashing about of the flatware is unusable the upside is that it is cheap and replaceable but count me among those who would rather pay more for something that lasts we are in the process of ditching the fiesta flatware line and moving to something more robust pros retro stylish inexpensive compared to quality flatware cons very poorly made expensive if you need to replace of flatware ever year,0
138,absolutely horrible ! the worst 20 i 've every spent this machine is an absolute waste of money i have had this machine fore 2 weeks and still have not found a cup small to fit it they are all either too wide or too tall a total headache when your rushing out to work,0
139,this item fell apart the moment i took it out of the box the sides literally came apart do not buy this product the company should be ashamed for even selling it,0
140,the first and only time i tried to use this compact carpet cleaner was a total disaster while removing an old sofa to make way for new furniture the delivery men stained the new carpet i whipped out our new atlantis filled the rinse tank and popped in the soap cartridge with manual in hand i tried to quickly clean the carpet as the new furniture was making its way up the stairs the unit did not dispense soapy water the wand leaked and finally i discovered that the body of the until was leaking all over my carpet creating a soggy new stain so here i am with two stains on my now very wet carpet furniture being delivered and an atlantis unit sitting in my bathtub until i can find a large sledge hammer do n't waste your money with this thing there has to be a better answer,0
141,i own many items from the le creuset stoneware collection and i must say that they are all of superb quality this square pan is perfect for baking and serving my favorite side dishes and desserts i have been impressed over and over again at how the surface of this bakeware is everything i have put into le creuset bakeware brownies casseroles refried beans etc has come clean with zero elbow grease in fact the dishwasher usually gets them sparkling clean without my help ! i highly recommend this product as well as everything else from this line,1
142,the first time i used this yogurt starter and it did not thicken i thought that it was my technique after reading and making several sucessful batches using store bought yogurt for the starter i tried another batch using the rolmex starter purchased at the same time as the original failed starter the results were the same no thickening just liquid others seem to have had good results so it is possible that the culture i received was not properly stored at some point before i received it or that it was just a bum lot,0
143,this fry cutter is good if you have a small potato and want some fries otherwise you will need to cut your potato first also it takes a bit of effort to use,1
144,zyliss makes different shaker with different color if you did n't catch this review it is just because this color is they all leak after 3 months of daily use i feel bad that i have another thing to full up the landfill,0
145,this is the bowl that we were looking for we found it at several places but had the best price they even beat the local discount '' cooking stor,1
146,i bought this sheet set almost 5 months ago they have actually become my favorite sheets i have several sets and many of them were quite exepensive but i always seem to reach for these sheets the only time we use another set is when we are washing these they are very soft stretchy not too stretchy and wash up so nice they hold the dryer warmth so well ! this set has been great during the summer i think will also be great during the colder months with a heavier blanket you could n't get a better set anywhere near this price !,1
147,these silicone pot holders are indeed brightly colored easy to wash in the dishwasher and protective even when wet they are also clumsily stiff at the same time as they are slippery the net result being a miserable failure in the kitchen they are useful for protecting a counter from a hot pot but not for picking the hot pot up,0
148,finding the right items to start the perfect kitchen for two is so easy thanks to oxo i love their good grips products all the handles look great but are also very comfortable and practical this strainer fits in well to a kitchen for feeding 2 or 3 people you can use this double rod strainer not only for straining but also for sifting flour draining and if need be awkwardly steaming veggies over boiling water it seems most people might go for the 8 '' instead but this one works perfectly for making gnocchi from scratch you have to make few enough in each batch that they can all rise to the top at once then you scoop them all up with the strainer the bigger strainer may be hard to fit in many pots drain the gnocchi and place on a paper towel since you can do all this with one hand you can use your other hand to grab more gnocchi to start ' quick as can be whatever you use it for this is a high quality strainer that will last,1
149,this set of knives is simply incredible a must for any kitchen especially a small one or if you just do a lot of quick small tasks these things are sharp and as standard for henckels supremely made,1
150,i have to admit that this is not as handy as i hoped it is big and clumsy and it 's a little too flexable,0
151,you are going to love this mug i bought it in the curry yellow and ended up buying three more the finish is beautiful and the shape fits your hand so well it is like satin as you hold it and it keeps your tea warm and wonderful the lip is perfect and not too thick buy one and see ! ! chantal products are the best check out their soup bowls,1
152,this is a brilliant device and the daddy of pizza wheels all pizza parlours should buy one or two they would save themselves a fortune ! one spin across the pizza and it 's done ! no repeated to and froing or worse finishing the job with a knife ! it does not need sharpening either just as well cos i am clueless as to how on earth you would do that job ! oxo brands are just really really good so start collecting now,1
153,its just a simple plastic tube that fits on the end of the grinder attachment so you can stuff sausage so how did they manage to mess this one up the flare at the wide end of the horn does not sit flat against the head of the grinder so when you go to tighten the ring down to hold it into place the collar can not screw on all the way the result a build up of meat in the front part of the collar this eventually begins to drip down making a bloody mess of whatever is under the grinder attachment how hard would it have been for kitchenaid to design the horn so it fitted flat in place and the collar would have screwed on tight,0
154,this is my third rowenta iron and they have all served me well but this is by far the best the steam is amazing you only have to made one pass on most items i know it is a lot of money for an iron but it is worth every penny for the time it saves,1
155,this pot rocks you 'll fall in love with it the first time you cook with it it browns well cleans easily and goes from the stove to the oven to the table in style my only complaint is that mine arrived slightly chipped but the chips do n't seem to affect its performance so i did n't send it back,1
156,nordic ware makes the best looking pans but this is my favorite pan from nordic ware ! this pan makes beautiful breads and cakes because it has a coating you might have to adjust your temperature to a higher setting when baking and even though it is i suggest that you spray it with oil before baking because sometimes it does stick ! it 's also very easy to clean up,1
157,we bought this to replace our 25 year old can opener after the blade on it snapped we looked around and quickly discovered that finding an inexpensive opener was easy but a quality opener was going to be a difficult task out of shear frustration we ended up selecting this black decker at first it seemed ok '' but after just a few months we are back to using our old manual hand wind '' opener the reason is that the top lever is too cheaply made and it flexes over time not much time ! it gets too loose to hold a can anymore we lock it in place it spins an inch or two and the can drops onto the counter repeat this scene over and over ! at the end the lid is never repeat never ! separated from the can ever ! it 's back to the hand held and a search of a decent electric continues,0
158,great product does what it 's suppose to do brushes are the best i have three huskies and it handles the dog hair expertly without clogging up for being such a heavy beastly unit i can not understand why the handle is built for such a petite hand it should be at least an inch longer so i can actually fit my hand in to it,1
159,i bought this item in october 2005 by january it had developed a crack across the bottom and up the side of the pitcher i contacted both amazon and emile henry about it amazon will only give a partial refund and emile henry told me to go through the merchant and did not offer that supposed warranty on their shoddy product do n't buy this piece of junk,0
160,this is my second the only reason for replacement is because the bowl cracked and it became cost effective to just make a machine rerplacement i have all the disks and such and like the machine very much as i have had it for 20 years,1
161,the feature 's on this machine are what drew me to choose krups espresso maker the pump instead of the pressure machines was the first draw the water tank and its size not having to fill it every day the fact that the frothing nozzle moved and the location of it and nobody makes a frothier frother than krups makes i love the lattes and i use a large stainless steel milk steaming pitcher you can make two cups at once i use it daily and sometimes more than once a day ! it makes a great espresso with beautiful crema i have not had any problems with this after every use i ca n't stress this enough and it only takes a minute to wipe the brew area and do the internal cleaning with solution often or you will get the slow drips of espresso when brewing because of deposit build ups follow cleaning instructions ! i highly recommend this one ! enjoy,1
162,this grill is awesome ! i ordered it to replace my old grill which did n't have the removeable plates and was worn down the removeable grills make this so easy to clean maybe takes 5 minutes i had looked at a couple of other contact grills from different manufacturers and though this one was more expensive i thought it had a better design than some of the others i looked it definitely recommended do n't hesitate to buy this if you 're thinking about it,1
163,i 've had to bring this back to hoover 5 times in less than a year the belt for the motor comes off ever other time i use the vacuum the button has been fixed 3 times it works when it wants to even the guy at the hoover store admitted that this piece of garbage is known for problems with the belt coming off i have nothing good to say about this i 'm a huge consumer reports fan but they missed the boat on this one they need to update their testing over the i 'm still pissed i blew 250 on this ridiculous excuse for a vacuum,0
164,you are better rolling your windows down ! this thing does not work i have a sharper image one that is alot better this one is a generic imitation that does not clean the air crap ! ! ! ! !,0
165,i have had the blue ecopods for well over a year now ilove the taste of the coffee and it does give a fair amount of foam but hard to clean i saw the presto mypod and leaped to try it the coffee overfills the cup making it too weak and no room for creamer there is absolutely no foam i got hooked on the senseo foam we will use it in a pinch but only on the 1 cup setting with 1 scoops,0
166,i found this product cumbersome and the instructions for assembly battery replacement etc were not very clear the vacuum did n't hold a charge well and it was hard to remove the batteries for replacement i finally gave up altogether and bought a different product,0
167,i was dissapointed that this item arrived broken and i needed to send it back for a refund,0
168,i am replacing the same product that i have used continually for the past nine years or so it has been an indispensable part of our kitchen all those years and we hope this new one will continue the tradition,1
169,i have purchased this item twice the first barely made it through a grill season and the second proved even less hearty the grill gets too hot for the wire and it burns through leaving two pices of probe wire there is no way to use this with a grill and get sustained use from it the same is true of all models sold as wireless '' are not wireless in terms of going from the meat to outside of the grill somebody needs to figure out how to make this tool without the probe wire that said before it becomes useless it works really well maybe the idea is to buy these by the case,0
170,this is not caphlon ! ! ! you can buy this at bed bath and beyond for 10 ! !,0
171,i 've never had a nice '' set of knives before these are great ! they have a nice feel in my hands the only reason i did n't give them a 5 star rating is because the kitchen scissors do not come apart the scissors i bought at smart final come apart for easy washing and drying,1
172,this thing is a piece of junk ! it 's the only blender i 've ever seen that comes with a stir stick '' to unclog the sides of the jar where the stuff all goes instead of into the blades this should have been a clue that the thing was n't very well designed and it was n't it always needed to be stirred when making any kind of smoothie several times which made the process a real pain also the drain spout is a great place for food to hide and get nasty except for the jar it 's pretty cheap plastic but it 's in the trash now because the couleing fried itself after two months good riddance,0
173,i own many circulon products but most of which are under the circulon 2 line so when this 2 pack became available i went ahead and purchased it i have only used it to cook eggs on and i must say i was sorely disappointed by the results not only did my eggs stick but i used quite a bit of oil on the batch to make sure they would n't stick but they still stuck my circulon 2 skillet makes far better eggs than this version and does n't stick ! i 'm not sure what i can use these skillets for now since my main intentions were for fish eggs and items which have a tendency to stick to the pan it also left a horrible look on the eggs like the kind on eggs cooked with a teflon pan without oil even though i used quite a bit of oil highly disappointed and will not purchase the circulon elite line again,0
174,i make homemade stocks a lot so having a good separater that can handle a large quantity is really useful this one works well and thanks to its design it cleans up easily in the dishwasher i have another one with a very thin spout and i have to wash it by hand if i let it sit at all after using it because the dishwasher jets ca n't seem to get into its narrow opening it 's a real pain i do not have that problem with this design to answer another reviewers ' question on plasic glass separaters i had a glass one and it broke despite being touted as heat resistant glass when i poured hot gravy into it last thanksgiving the glass went flying everywhere as it broke right in my hand ! admittedly that was an older one and perhaps the newer glass versions are more rugged when it comes to heat but i just do n't have that worry using a plastic one i 'm not an industrial designer but given the way that plastic is made at exceptionally high heat i am not aware of any health implications regarding pouring warm liquids into plastic,1
175,at first we loved this pan we 've used it quite a bit but recently it has started to warp and it gets worse when it is heated i can no longer sear a roast and then put it in the oven because the pan is so uneven i 've contacted all clad and am waiting to see what they say needless to say i would have been much happier with a less expensive pan i am very happy with all the other all clad pans that we have but this one is a disappointment,0
176,the vacu vin wine saver works great it keeps wine fresh in the refrigerator for weeks also it is very easy to use,1
177,i agree with other writers this unit is very poorly designed and built cutting my third loaf of bread the knife point came out of the guide and on return snaped one of the guides off not washable end plate falls off while cutting all the time unit slides over the counter when trying to cut rubber feet would have cured this i would look elsewhere before buying this unit,0
178,makes the best long grain brown rice that i 've ever tasted only wish that zojirushi made a 5 cup version of the induction rice cooker,1
179,i should have listened to the other reviewers which i usually do i followed the directions to the letter put it on in degree weather and never felt cool at all in fact after several minutes i actually felt hotter and was sweating as much as without this thing on even if it had worked it was very uncomfortable i am suprised that sharper image sells such a bad product,0
180,you look at them in a picture frame fish are crammed in there,0
181,i 'm sticking with the lighter colors due to scratching my persimmon 16 piece setting arrived with two dinner plates scratched i think next time i 'll order them as individual place settings as they were n't packed well amazon will give me a 20 discount for keeping them,1
182,let me begin with a positive note on the oxo good grips oven mitt it looks great and the magnet is a good idea now for the negative aspects of this item it 's way especially for how poorly it is designed the way this oven mitt is designed does not give you a good grip '' which is ironic since it 's called the oxo good grips '' oven mitt it 's hard to explain but the silicone part is somewhat stiff and when you put your hand in the mitt you can not easily grab things especially if what you 're trying to grab is small like a pan lid or narrow like the handles on a roaster pan it 's like this mitt was designed as though the only thing anyone uses an oven mitt for is to take hot cookie sheets out of the oven i decided not to give it one star only because it does a good job of insulating your hand from high temperatures i strongly suggest that if you are considering purchasing this oxo mitt you should go to a store and try it on first to see what you think about the design,0
183,i had slightly older edition of the krups crystal aroma for several years until i lost one carafe too many if you 're careless when empty they tend to roll like a bowling ball right off the countertop but that 's my fault the crystal aroma carafe looks cool and the filter would probably help if you have unpleasant tap water but overall the quality of the coffee it produces is merely the reason not to buy this coffeemaker is that krups now makes a much better one aroma control '' is a poor description for the recent line of krups coffeemakers by that name actually do the aroma control machines have a simple but ingenious mechanism for retaining the coffee in the brewing chamber for an extra minute before letting it drip through into the carafe more than filters or an exotic shape that supposedly retains aromas that extra minute of brewing makes all the difference in the world unless you 're just in love with that round carafe skip the crystal aroma '' and move on to the aroma control '' line,0
184,they are very big the spoons are very uncomfortable to use they should have been smaller and a better grip,1
185,it works great and it 's small 6 '' high 5 '' diameter and easy to use may require some experimentation to get times correct for your own microwave for me 7 minutes for soft 8 min for medium and min for hard eggs on high power microwave it does get very hot so you need to remove it from the microwave with a potholder or towel i place the whole thing under the cold tap then remove the top and cool the eggs under running water for a minute before peeling,1
186,after checking every store i could think of and accepting that i 'd have to go online i laughed when i saw this price ! what was coffee thinking i read the other reviews of these filters and became aware that i do n't even need them ! duh i have filtered water in our house ! thank you train man '' the little carbon filter sounded like a good idea but my coffee will survive without it at least it 's not a total loss because i like the coffee maker itself happy brewing,0
187,works well and looks great but lifting is not fun if you are a weight lifter always looking for a few more reps for your wrist elbow and shoulder get this kettle this stainless one is listed at 6.4 lbs and the white plastic is listed at 2.9 lbs a big difference ! the stainless one weighs empty close to what the plastic one weighs full with a minimum fill of liter the stainless weighs in at 7.4 lbs and the plastic at 4.0 lbs i 'm returning my stainless unit and ordering the plastic one,0
188,i got the machine yesterday and was so excited i got it all ready to prime by following the directions and it did n't work after several attempts i called bunn customer service thinking that i must be doing something wrong when i talked to the customer service he told me that the machine was n't pumping hot water into the reservoir and that this was a common problem with the machine i 'm thinking for 200.00 this is n't right and why has n't the company fixed it he was very nonchalant about it as if it did n't matter just get a new one this just is n't acceptable to me there are many positive reviews so i 'm sure if you get a working one than you 'll probably be happy with it as for me i refuse to use something that has a known problem that the company is n't even trying to remedy therefore i 'm sending it back to amazon for a full refund and buying the simple human coffee maker which has gotten great reviews,0
189,when i bought my first littermaid box i thought it was a miracle no more scooping ! hooray ! it worked so well for my four cats that a few months later i bought a second one unfortunately the second box quit working after just a couple of weeks and i 'd thrown the receipt away so i could n't get my money back soon after that the original box quit working too so within about 6 months i spent close to 200 on electric boxes that no longer functioned after researching better and more reliable options i 've settled on the omega paw box that you roll to clean i now have three of them no electric parts to break and actually less mess than the littermaid,0
190,i bought these in a few colors at a higher price about a month ago they were purchased to replace some designer catalog towels that i mistakenly thought would be of better quality well the designer towels shed about their heft in my drier so here i came to amazon looking for a better alternative i ordered 3 sets of these and am impressed with their drying ability and their feel the towels are nice and thick and absorbent like a towel should be right the package of six include two sets making this an even better deal i just went back and bought another three sets for use over the holidays with out of town guests you wo n't be sorry with these i am tossing my old towels and using these sets almost exclusively,1
191,i knew what i was buying so there were n't any surprises the only thing i do not like about them is the shallowness i wanted that feature for storage but i did n't take into account how easy it is to be messy when mixing i would suggest having another bowl around for use with an electric mixer i like them and i would buy them,1
192,this product had the best reviews but the performance was not at all very good i found it very awkward to roll the litter box you still have to bend down and tip the litter box all the way over to get the clumps into the pull out tray and that 's the clumps that are n't stuck in the litter filter piece which gets easily clogged and is not really something i want to deal with cleaning besides not all clumps going into the tray lots of unused litter ended up in the tray as well also i bought the 'regular ' size one and the filter piece goes almost right in the middle of the space so the usable cat space was very small needless to say i returned the litter box and was so glad to have the old fashioned scoop litter box,0
193,this is the best spatula i have ever owned and i have owned entirely too many it is strong and wide and slightly curved at the front edge to fit my pans the front edge is also nice and thin so it slides right under any food and it cleans up like holes for junk to get stuck in and you can rest it right on the skillet without it melting or lay it on the counter because the handle is curved in such a manner as to keep the head from resting on the countertop best spatula ever,1
194,i have owned a lot of crappy toasters and actually have n't gotten another for the past 6 years i 've resorted to pan toasting in order to avoid another bad purchase finally got tired of so much effort for toast and broke down and got this toaster it 's so easy to use and it even defrosts frozen bread and can warm up an already toasted slice without retoasting worked amazingly well to heat a cold slice of pizza but i 'm sure braun is cringing if they read this ! i love the little pull out tray you do n't have to pick up the whole darn thing and hold it over the sink and beat it to death ! the toast comes out very even and perfectly toasted every time slots are wide too so a bagel is no problem it is fast too so you wo n't miss it not being a 4 slice toaster i think you will be pleased with this great toaster i am,1
195,this food chopper is my favorite extra appliance in the kitchen for salsas the low speed lets me keep the ingredients chunky for sauces the higher speed can easily puree most ingredients my favorite item to use it for is onions and it saves alot of tears the large bowl not only holds alot but is also very easy to clean i highly recommend this food chopper for frequent or casual dicing cook,1
196,the information on the pages that pertain to this hose needs to be changed to reflect the fact that the hose does not fit hoovers with a hepa system it only fits hoovers with product 's beginning i ordered it along with a new windtunnel that has a hepa system since the product information stated that these 2 items were bought together by other people unfortunately it does not state that these people now including me have to return the hose because it does not fit all windtunnels so be sure to check and doublecheck before you buy,0
197,this is a great device and has multiple settings to keep tasks on track very full featured and easy to use,1
198,these towels are great ! i was surprised how large they are but it 's been a while since i bought towels maybe all new towels are really big these towels are so absorbent it 's hard to tell when they 've been used because the water just seems to disappear and soft soft soft brand new out of the box they feel great again they 're big so a litle heavy but they are wonderful these are an amazing bargain and feel very luxurious i do n't know what towels those other reviewers said resulted in fuzzies they must have been referring to another product these towels are awesome no fuzzies they are very well made,1
199,i have read a few reviews about this machine and some how i am not sure what i missed i purchased this machine about 8 months ago i loved the look of it in my kitchen with all my stainless appliances that is where it ends this machine has been terrible when you put water in it the filter part floats up and out of the slot letting water get into the machine unfiltered when your filling your cup you have to bend down in front of the machine to see where the coffee is in the cup or it will overflow making more for you to clean up i just want coffee ! ! ! even though the inside unit '' that holds the coffee does come out it is not designed to fit into the front of a refrig to put water in it you have to use something else to catch the water from the refrig then dump that into this machine they put little time into the of this machine i hesitate to add this as i do n't want anyone reading this to think my home is dirty in florida we tend to see palmetto bugs this machine has about 5 vent holes in the top of it i had two bugs get in the machine they had full access to the water reservior once i filled the water reservior the bugs came flying out that was the end of this machine for me poor design issues and not sanitary by any means look on !,0
