0,they should stop milking it with crappy film franchises like the texas chainsaw massacre this series should have been killed off by now the first was not even worth watching ! stay away from this whole movie series,0
1,i saw the trailer for this film numerous times in the theatre i thought it was going to be another run of the mill comedy that just happens to take place in a greasy fast food joint not even close ! this movie is strange and should someday earn cult status besides i like watching drew barrymore,1
2,this program is evil it is easy to get sucked into watching gantz because of the unique and inexplicable situation that the main characters who have all died find themselves in they have gone to purgatory and purgatory is like an video game one feels compelled to continue on with the series to begin to answer some of these mysteries the art direction is decent visually it does n't look cheap the english voice acting is embarassingly bad especially the main character but not as bad as the dialogue internal and vocalized that this character has been given to speak the worst thing about this series apart from the juvenile humor about breasts and boners is the action '' scenes these inevitably play out with the people in danger standing around arguing and philosophizing about what to do when the obvious course of action is to take the guns that are in their hands and shoot at their alien adversaries like there is no tomorrow after you witness a few of these frustrating situations on the video if you do n't feel like banging your head against the wall you are made of stronger stuff than this first set of episodes leaves the viewer with more questions than answers and more frustration than satisfaction save yourself the pain,0
3,to anchor bay entertainment if you release the grey fox on dvd we 'll buy it ! this is truly a great film five stars is as good as it gets can you ask for more incentive than that,1
4,i picked this set up despite reservations reservations being luke perry and the guy from the cosby show because of the creator michael straczynski unfortunately the show is just not up to snuff it 's really nothing more then a c average show normally that 's not a big deal but when you consider this is on a premium channel showtime and costs over 70.00 on dvd it 's just not good enough specific problems i had with the show include a lot of filler episodes the season is only 18 episodes long and at least half are stand alones that contribute nothing to the overall story line the show would have been better off with only 12 episodes all geared towards a single over riding story this is the model that hbo uses production value is also sorely lacking once again i 'm going to compare to hbo i feel this is fair since these are both pay to view networks the hbo series carnivale has unbelievable production value the set 's locations costumes and visual effects are all motion picture quality the same can be said for deadwood and rome but carnival makes for a better comparison but jeremiah all looks the same you can tell the show was all shot in the same location every back road and town look like they are in the same county the biggest problem however is just the premise a post genocidal virus world populated by orphaned children seems like a good idea but in practice it get 's tired fast i had to force myself through the last 9 episodes luke perry 's quest to find valhalla sector fails to add any intrigue or mystery simon 's quest to rebuild civilization also comes up flat and any moral or social lessons conveyed are thinly veiled so basically it is neither exciting nor intelligent plus if you need any other reason to dislike this show then know that jason presley makes a guest appearance just what this show needed a 90210 reunion if you 're looking for a great show this is not it if you can watch it cheap give a whirl but do n't waste any hard earned cash on this one,0
5,this movie is utterly unremarkable actually scratch that this movie is actually very remarkable because of how bad it is first of all the protagonist is pathetic it 's impossible for the viewer to sympathize with her because she is just a pitiful weak person who does absolutely nothing to try and solve her problems all she does is cry and moan second the actors are some of the most wooden and stiff performers i 've seen in any movie third there are some plot gaps and questions that never get answered which disrupt the movie 's flow and continuity for example the protagonist gets hit by an truck and her car is absolutely mangled but she walks away without a scratch someone care to explain how that 's possible i probably would have stopped watching this excuse for a movie if i was n't at a friend 's house and there 's the fact that it 's his movie i sat through it just to be polite when all is said and done this movie just is n't worth your time i 'm glad i 'm not the one who actually paid my dollars to buy this piece of dung,0
6,excellent delivered in a very timely manor new condition i could not have been more pleased,1
7,this film was not what i expected it was so plain i was about ready to turn it off others may like it though,0
8,the question at hand in the film paradise lost is not as much did these three teenagers commit this heinous act but rather was there enough evidence to convict them for the murders the answer presented by material in the film is an unflinching no there was only speculation and rumor to convict the three the film 's strengths are that it does n't preach at least not in an overly wrought narrative and it contains intimate moments with the accused and their families as well as the families of the victims i can understand the pain and confusion of the victim 's families what is hard to understand is the bloodlust and need for revenge and retribution that immediately takes hold of them the victims ' families are the most terrifying aspect of this film at one point the mother of the byrnes child says in a hateful and spiteful tone i hate them i hate them and the mother 's that bore them '' is there anything wrong with being hellishly angry with someone who has butchered your child no quite natural really but the point of this film is that judgment was passed on these kids long before the trial even started i imagine the bible belt is a very scary place to be raised in i 'll have to ask brad pitt what he thinks about it some time on the issue of the prosecution they had next to nothing a very questionable confession from a terrified kid jessie with a 72 iq hearsay from a couple of kids who claim they heard damien bragging about the murder but have no proof a knife found behind damien 's house which does n't match the wounds on the bodies and the assertion that because damien read about wicca he must be a satanist to look at the three kids is also an interesting aspect of the film jessie a very small and slow kid seems a bit lost in the world his iq is low but he has no previous records of any type of behavior that would associate him with murder jason speaks in short breathless words and seems also to suffer from a low iq damien is the key to everything in this film though the defense made the key mistake of letting damien take the stand for two reasons the first reason is that damien appears to have add and after the first 10 minutes of questioning he sort of fades away and answers in bland yes and no 's the second reason and the most important is that damien is obviously extremely bright normally this would n't seem to be a problem but judging from every single person the filmmakers put on camera smart people are hard to come by in that area of the world damien scared them all of this adds up to the fact that there was not enough evidence to put these kids away and there were other more sinister and shocking suspects that needed to be pursued the war rages on for the west memphis three and it is indeed frightening to think that they did it and terrifying to think they didn't,1
9,i bought this dvd for my collection i do not buy full screen format dvds amazon described the dvd as anamorphic color dolby full screen widescreen ntsc '' with an aspect ration of however when it arrived it was full screen only with an aspect ratio of consequently i returned it my recommendation if you only want widescreen do n't believe the description that this dvd is and do n't buy it,0
10,ferris bueller matthew broderick is a kind of hero to every aged young adult out there he 's the kind of guy whom we all want to be really he acts like he does n't have a care in the world and lives life to fullest the opposite of this guy would be his best friend cameron frye alan ruck a sort of uptight worrywart who deserves to be brought out of his shell by the easygoing ferris in this film ferris fakes out his parents into calling it another sick '' day for him his ninth to be exact in order to convince just about everyone that he is really sick he consults his collection of electronic sound effect equipment for the process another antithesis of ferris is his sister jeannie jennifer grey who suspects something is up as does the dean of students ed rooney jeffrey jones it 's funny how so many trains of thoughts seem to dominate this movie and in the events that happen for instance ferris says that he has to keep coming up with new illnesses in order to make 10 sick days it 's amazing people like his parents who are most easily duped would think that this one sick kid when in reality he 's having a ball however knowing that if he gets cauught and may not graduate he decides to make this one count and be worthwhile ferris and cameron bail out ferris ' girl sloane mia sara with a dead grandmother ploy and together the trio spend the day doing the town in chicago driving the gt convertible oh yeah ! this movie has a special message and feeling to it that 's as old as time it 's about conquering fears mostly and just really appreciating life for after all as our hero says life moves pretty fast if you do n't stop to take a look every once in a while you might miss it '' that 's the moral of the story really bueller bueller bueller '' not here but he 'll be there in your own home sharing his funny but wise philosophies of life and showing you how to open your eyes in making the most of every day,1
11,gina is just like the protesters she just does n't get it ! '' the liberal way of doing anything is throw more of our tax money at it ! whereas africa 's problems including poverty aids will never be solved until they get the birth rate down ! as long as more babies are born than people dying their population goes up very bad the only way to eliminate poverty is less children ! ! send money for that but nothing else,0
12,ca n't remember when i 've seen a film with more depraved and pathetic characters than this a silent screen star who lives in a sinister dark house surrounded by a gzillion of her own photos and a weirdo butler essentially kidnap a holiday screen writer down on his luck the writer wanders onto what appears to be deserted property and hides his car trying to escape a finance the threesome make the creepiest trio you could ever imagine in one early scene they have a funeral casket and all for a monkey yuk gloria swanson was directed to play a woman who still thinks she can make a come back by writing her own script though she despises movies that talk '' she waves her hands about and makes strange corny expressions with her face in every scene she falls for the screen writer william holden and wo n't let him out of her sight the film was made in 1950 and swanson is supposed to be playing a woman of only 50 not exacty over the hill if we look at many of today 's movie stars but she 's treated in the film as though she much much older i thought she was supposed to be about 75 or so but her age is mentioned towards the end of the film my heavens at 50 she could still be in movies and from the amount of money she apparently had did n't need to be living in such a dark creepy house film did n't make sense sorry i bought it it was ridiculous,0
13,a film about the porn industry in the late 70 's early 80 's great cast great performances great story just a great film unique approach to the subject characters that are flashy yet human with real emotion characters played by julianne moore don cheadle heather graham william macy and burt reynolds respectfully are great to watch this is a performance piece,1

16,least its in my top 5 'm not the biggest chaplin of a keaton and dang if this movie dose n't do me in never fail to fall into hysterics over the feeding chair '' the gibberish several other i always get teary eyed over the plight of charlie and his little love movie just packs so much into its 89 or so minutes and it all flows beautifully from one frame to the next ! do n't be botherd by the hype about this being a social a commie film or whatever ! still the same little tramp who goes against any kind of social order ! ! i have this wonderful new 2 disc version from the chaplin collection box to pull out every christmas holiday with city i 'm want to check out the little cuban documentary on the second disc about the traveling projectionists who take the movie to a remote farming village to show to the people for the first tears in these peoples eyes as they you everything about this wonderful one of a kind film,1
17,ella of frell anne hathaway is an unusual child as a baby a bumbling fairy godmother named lucinda vivica fox gave her the gift of obedience every time anyone gives her a direct command she must obey despite or maybe because of this gift '' ella grows to be a headstrong woman she goes against the conventional wisdom of the realm when it comes to ogres giants and elves current rules state that these creatures are dangerous and must perform certain jobs only but ella campaigns for their equality she is also one of the few women in the realm who does n't swoon at the site of prince char hugh dancy when the two meet accidentally char finds this distain quite refreshing and immediately begins to fall for the headstrong young woman trouble is brewing at home however ella 's stepsister hattie lucy punch has figured out ella 's secret now ella finds herself doing things she would never willing do so she leaves home and sets out to find lucinda to give the gift back i had missed seeing this movie in the theater and finally got a chance to watch it i missed a real treat the movie is funny from start to finish and i had a grin on my face the entire time while the story is a bit predictable it is n't super preachy the cast does an amazing job bring their characters to life the only drawback to the movie is the special effects while some worked well most of the time they were n't up to today 's standards while the main audience might be teen girls this is one adult male who loved it it 's sweet charming and entertaining what more could you want,1
18,i 'll cut to the since plot and story have already been well outlined in previous reviews the basic message of this film seems to be that state controlled education '' is worthy of resurrection and total dictatorship is the way to achieve it though the latter point is probably true the former is questionable indeed why try and save an obviously moribund and mindless system of government indoctrination from its own demise do n't blame the kids you have only to look at the state of the world to see the utter failure that educated people have already created everywhere with world fascism now its ultimate fruitage and the kids at some level know it clearly we urgently need a new vision of education altogether but this film only asks us to glorify what has already died,0
19,for the idiot that wrote that day 1 for fifty was in 2003 in da abviously dont know that fifty has been on the seen since 98 u idoit ur a fake rap fan and u should know ya history instead of talking on curtis jackson a douche bag,0
20,this was a blast from the past for my husband and we purchased this for our 6 and 7 year olds and they really like it it fits right where they are in school and they laugh while they are learning often when we are doing homework i 'll say that 's what they said on the electric company '' or remember what the electric company said this letters sound like '' and they do it 's been a joy to see something from my childhood work for them it 's great to play in the morning while they are getting ready for school plus i have to admit seeing morgan freeman and bill cosby in this is quite hilarious mistakes and all !,1
21,great movie the problem is in the medium of delivery there are 2 dvds in the package each dvd contains approximately of the movie the would be better served if the entire movie was on one dvd in addition the dvd is defective the scene where alexander 's father is assasinated consists of some normal footage many lengthy 'still ' pictures no picture at all for a period of time and a short period that looked like satelite feed was breaking all on a dvd that 's supposed to be flawless,0
22,ignore the blurb on the vhs box the movie is not about a couple 's hot parties with hip friends it is about a couple 's awful parties with jerk friends now that might not be a bad thing in fact i think it could be easier to make a good movie about bad parties than about good ones but the advertising is dishonest much worse though is the the pointless and boring character of the movie which is about a bunch of stupid or verbally sadistic friends '' who mostly do n't like each other while i 've known cliques that keep getting together despite frictions between some members it 's inconceivable that these people would keep getting together for these abusive and tedious holiday events also the couples ' relationships which come and go between these parties are unexplained and mostly unexplored as are some individuals ' character changes and indeed almost everything that does n't happen at the parties themselves,0
23,i hear this is a good movie but ca n't play it as the dvd is visibly damaged so what about quality control this disc should never have gotten out the door but the odd thing is i ordered 2 dvd 's from amazon different titles both damaged are you guys buying and pawning them off on us f,0
24,the weight of water kathryn bigelow 2000 this movie should have been a big production an adaptation of an anita shreve novel directed by near dark 's kathryn bigelow starring a handful of actors so why does it seem like a lifetime original movie tm on steroids jean janes shadow of the vampire 's catherine mccormack is obsessed with a pair of murders that occurred on the isles of shoals in 1873 when louis wagner rome 's ciaran hinds was convicted of the murders of two women and executed jean is n't sure they got the right person she and her poet husband thomas sean penn set off for the islands on a boat with thomas ' brother rich josh lucas recently of poseidon and rich 's new girlfriend adaline elizabeth hurley who went from this right on to film bedazzled the interpersonal relationships on the boat cause tensions to flare as everyone seems to want pretty much everyone else and the situation on the boat brings jean to a possible revelation of an alternative theory of the crime it 's an interesting premise and from everything i 've heard it 's carried off quite successfully in the book which i have n't read but oh it does n't work well at all in the film the links between the two stories are shown only by the way the two stories are intercut no work at all was done on trying to parallel the two in any structural way most of the actors are wasted here even the vastly talented mccormack seems only a shadow of her usual irrepressible self while sarah polley whose story takes place over in the nineteenth century time frame seems as if she 's worn down by a lot more than inimical primitive island life about the only actor who 's really effective here is hinds who plays his role to the hilt it 's not the worst movie i 've seen in the past month but it 's pretty close,0
25,lil abner is a delightful with stronger emphasis on comedy than most movie musicals this film version of the broadway hit musical that was based on the legendary comic strip looks fantastic on dvd in a beautiful print with it 's comic book coloring it 's also superbly cast the film 's producers did take a risk hiring two unknowns to play lil abner and daisy mae peter palmer who starred in the broadway show and leslie parrish but they are perfectly cast and excellent in the roles it 's hard to picture any major male movie stars of the period as abner anyway although daisy mae might have been played by a number of buxom blondes of the era it 's a shame neither palmer or parrish went on to much movie work after this although both were quite active guest starring on television for many years both are mighty fine delectable representations of their sexes appeals as the dogpatch crowd might say it 's true that perhaps only a few of the songs are memorable notably jublian cornpone '' a typical day in dogpatch '' and put 'em back the way they was '' which is sung by five hillbilly cuties including the very young valerie harper rhoda '' and beth howland alice '' but most of the songs are and enthusically put over by the cast and dancers most of whom were in the original broadway show jerry lewis has a funny cameo and the gorgeous julie newmar and stella stevens have amusing secondary roles most of the ladies in the picture are making their film debuts here including donna douglas as the busty hillbilly girl a few years before becoming famous as one on the beverly hillbillies who wants to broaden our horizons '' and is informed by mammy yokum superbly played by billie hayes that she her horizons is broaden enough there 's quite a bit of political satire in here as well with politicans with such apt names as mayor dogmeat and senator jack phigbound and the sadie hawkins day sequence a dogpatch storyline that became a pop culture phenomeon of it 's own with many high schools for years having an annual sadie hawkins dance '' in where girls would be the ones to ask guys for a date years before this was considered acceptable '' is a lot of fun but then so is the movie as a yoakam says when they really mean it i has spoken ! '',1
26,i saw this movie in the theater and was amazed at how quiet it was in there ! since i was bored i found myself looking at other people there to see if i could get a read on what they were thinking and after it was over i asked my friend what he thought he said oh it was okay '' but did n't elaborate so let me it was painfully unfunny with jokes or punchlines that fell flat horrible acting totally predictable and very forgetable this is a movie you might want to rent only if you 're really bored and nearly every other movie is out and even then you 'd be better off to go home empty handed there 's not even much eye candy to recommend which is a nice fallback if there 's nothing else going for it how people could give this movie anything more than 1 star is puzzling just because you like a movie should n't mean you give it 5 stars especially when it 's as bad as this one i mean i liked freddy vs jason but there 's no way i 'd give that movie 4 or 5 stars this is bottom of the barrel,0
27,i have been an adult swim viewer since space ghost ctc 's early days the venture brothers is probably my favorite of them all the brak show was a riot also i am in my 40 's and so i can relate to all the jokes on the stuff i grew up on marvel dc johnny quest scooby doo etc the formula started with sgctc taking mundane kids 's shows and tossing them in adult situations filled with lots of sexual references many homosexual uber violence for violence 's sake profanity beeped out but you know what they are saying well you get my drift think excrement jokes it 's ted turner in his old coot liberal ways taking everything that was semi american of good bad in cartoons and screwing it all to hell but despite the same formula over and over sgctc harvey birdman aal the brak show robot chicken aqua team hunger force sealab 2021 and probably some others i missed i still watch and laugh with the venture brothers being the best of them all one thing that i really laugh about is that the teens and gen x'ers watching have little or no reference for where these jokes are coming from they are just laughing at the situations and do n't get the parody i tried to tell a whose 25 years old about a robot chicken bit about hogan 's heroes and he never heard of that show ! i 'm glad the venture brothers has got a strong audience so thanks you young ignorant types for watching ! i 'm in baby boomer delight !,1
28,this documentary is very concise and very straight forward it does not beat around the bush or preach to the choir it features interviews with some very credible sources all of whom have their unique take on such a timely discussion topic i really enjoyed the way the interviews were woven together this documentary makes a great point and i 'd highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in learning the hard facts about the drug industry and its ethics,1
29,if you sort of like edwin mccain get this dvd watch him live and you will fall in love he has such passion for his music that can only be seen and felt during live performances his amazing voice is just as amazing live and he and his band can jam ! ! the energy is high and its a great time ! i had the priviledge of meeting him and blubbered like an idiot but he is just as cool a guy as he seems he really appreciates his fan base and understands how important it is for us to see him live im glad that finally i can share with my friends who have never see edwin live what an amazing artist he really is ! ! ! !,1
30,i am very disappointed with this movie the philadelphia experiment '' that have no english subtitles due to my deafness i was planning to buy this dvd i have seen it many times in late and have been waiting for the english subtitles since,1
31,this movie was more than i expected i was astonished at the amazing graphic and effects and especially the robots you are kept wondering who the true villian is until the very end i did not expect it to be who it was the reason why i rated this movie a four instead of a five was for the almost constant swearing from smith i was not prepared for it especially since the movie is not rated for language other than that i highly recommend this movie,1
32,this is a dvd not only for wrasslin ' fans but for all of mankind you will learn the ways of the warrior and hopefully learn something about yourself as well,1
33,if there was ever a movie that exposed the hypocrisy and meanness in people this would be it ! o'hara beautifully played by mia farrow does n't trust edwina the new beauty that 's come to town the two battle it out with edwina coming out the loser in the end or does she if i said any more i 'd be spoiling the story just watch this movie and enjoy things are never what they seem and i promise the ending will be worth staying for,1
34,the books are witty and charming this in stark contrast is formulaic schlock americans and much of the world 's consumers prefer their entertainment predigested so it does n't require chewing so they consume the same nutritionless movieland cliches endlessly in the land of limitless equality everything is reduced to equal tastelessness if you want impart the capacity for discernment to your child you could start by avoiding this twaddle the eloise books are special while this movie is mere product,0
35,i truly love this film and it 's one of my top favorite film of all time the cinematography is absolutely beautiful if you enjoy violence beauitful scenery of brazil a great related story this film is absolutely brillant,1
36,i normally praise disney 's animated movies but i 've got to draw the line somewhere i ca n't believe the average review for this movie was stars i found the characters in this movie annoying even more annoying than that suv commercial where that guy walks out of his house and parachutes off the cliff i urge you to buy treasure planet any disney pixar film tarzan before this one,0
37,i hate to trash on an american classic but this was truly horrible i thought my son would like this due to the flying car it took hours of torture to get to that scene horrible horrible film mindless banter and weak story line our copy eventually broke stepped on we felt sooo lucky to have it gone one star '' seems like a generous rating,0
38,this truly is a horrible movie 7 seconds huh yeah 7 seconds to realize i made a mistake in renting it the acting is horrible the plot is horrible the filming is horrible everything is horrible ! i was hopeful because of snipes which is why i rented it despite not ever seeing the movie anywhere before in the theaters the guy at the store even told us that he was told it was a good movie ! snipes could n't even do the fight scenes and make them look real the ending is a car chase that ends so abruptly that you suddenly see them sitting next to a pond behind their house completely in love ! huh they were a romantic interest they hinted at it but never showed this happening do not rent or buy this movie stay away or you will be sucked into it shaking your head wondering why you rented this movie,0
39,well i thought it was going to stop at volume 1. but i guess it did n't but i am amazed that some of the cast is still living i ca n't believe that skip hinnant who plays fargo north decoder has got gray hair and still seems to be in good health not to mention jim boyd who plays arthur crank is also still alive but on the heavy side as for judy graubart i ca n't believe how old and skin and bones she is she must 've been the oldest actor on the cast because now you should see her today hattie winston poor thing i think she must 've suffered a stroke or something cause i 've noticed in her interviews she twitches every now and then we hardly ever see morgan freeman in any of these interviews because he 's a big time busy actor but i loved the show and am glad they brought this collection together in another set of dvd 's from a show i grew up watching when i was 10. luis avalos who i loved watching not just on the electric company but in his acting career in movies like stir crazy and then a full role in dom deluise 's hot stuff along with his family luis still looks the same but has gained some weight too like jim boyd it is great that the graphics and color of the sets on each show brings back memories and the songs they sang too brought back some memories it is also hard to believe that the voices you hear on the cartoon skits like letterman are zero mostel gene wilder joan rivers and mel brooks you would n't have thought that there voice talents would be a credit to their success today well now we have to get ready for volume 3 there be let 's hope so cause i will surely buy it !,1
40,i read the book in middle school and watched the movie shortly afterwards a few of the characters were switched around but i was so impressed with the adaptation a thriller that still makes me nervous and jumpy the kids in the kitchen scene and when arnold 's arm drops on ellie 's shoulder as she 's trying to turn the generator back on for example there have been countless lines i 've memorized and quoted at appropriate and innapropriate times due to my obsession and after watching it more than 25 times i 've come to appreciate it more great cast sam neil is my favorite richard attenborough is a little too cute and nice but i liked his white clothing the hat and the amber cane wayne knight was incredible as nedry the slob he 's as likeable as ever though somewhat the villain i always hate it when he dies jeff goldblum fit the description of ian malcom from crichton 's novel well crichton sparked my interest in chaos theory sometimes called the butterfly effect i am a firm believer in it and of course in the novel and film malcolm was right life finds a way '' in chaos theory the system is very sensitive to small changes in external conditions and random '' unpredictable events result from the normal '' because there is never a fixed set of outcomes the system is unpredictable because of its complexity hammond thought his system was without error that he was in complete control he believed that the dinosaurs would fail to reproduce because all were engineered to be female but he was wrong the dinosaurs evolved because of the replacement amphibian dna that was used to fill in the gaps in the dinosaur dna this dna gave the dinosaurs the ability to change sex in order to reproduce survive '' in a environment and it turned out that hammond was wrong about many other equations things are not as black and white as he thought and it is problematic to predict behavior of his animals love the scene where the lawyer is eaten while sitting on the toilet we watched the dna segment in a high school biology class i 've always thought it explained the process very well for something that is complicated though i found hammond 's live speaking lines to be unrealistic was he really planning to be there for each tour the kids were kind of annoying i did n't notice this until i was a little older but lex i prefer to be called a hacker '' uses silicon graphics ' file system navigator to turn power back on in the park their logo is on the monitor if only unix were as popular as windows is now anyway the soundtrack was classic it was the first cd i bought back in the tonya harding skated to the theme at the 1994 olympics or some other competition i only liked her because of her excellent music choice,1
41,i was so bored by this film that i thought i might be missing some subtle french cultural context or emotional triggers that would make it interesting i asked a younger french female friend who said she found it at least as boring as i did the characters did n't engage my sympathy nothing explained why these people were even remotely interested in each other so i did n't care what happened to them scenes like long car drives from the marriage bed to a first infidelity did n't build any dramatic tension or advance a plot or provide any interesting insight into the characters themselves the sex scenes were banal and the bondage episodes in particular laughable i sat through to the end thinking there might perhaps be some breathtaking ending to redeem the wasted minutes i want my money back plus damages,0
42,i 've heard it said that if you have n't read the book you 'd be lost in this movie i read the book and it was still a bit confusing ! i like this version of the film with all the extra footage such a fantastic looking picture this was i saw this in the theater when it came out i remember a bit of controversy regarding the billing sting was touted as starring in this film when in reality he had a supporting role shame on the movie execs who tried to capitalize off of his name and the then massive popularity of his band the police it was nothing more than a ploy to get his fans into the theater having said that sting is actually pretty good in this film he sneers he wise cracks he fights and he looks pretty in his futuristic speedo of course he gets killed in the end oh well,1
43,i love this movie how can you not with such hilarious diologue one of my most favorites is when yzma outlines her first plan to get rid of kuzko ending with a hilarious i 'll smash it with a hammer ! '' but diologue aside there 's so much more to this movie the characters are so wonderfully individual from kuzko to evil yzma with her secret lab '' to dim witted kronk with his shoulder angel and devil secondly look what i can do um i do n't see how that no no he 's got a point over and over agian this movie will keep you laughing watch and enjoy,1
44,here 's the awful truth '' that you would be willing to let this man a raving terminally obese incoherent highschool dropout who is to truth what a lead block smeared with ketchup is to cheesecake you would let this man literally plunge his stained mitts into your skull forming the mushy stuff of your brain into little foamy pink chunks of liberal pabulum and that you would pay him money to render the service ! yes you could watch all of the episodes in the awful truth '' you would no doubt feel smug and superior to all those unenlightened troglodytes who voted for bush you might giggle a bit which is a common of a political lobotomy but at the end of the day it is far better that you take your lead from antiquity when oedipus realized his own version of the awful truth '' he had whacked pa gotten jiggy with ma and generally made an of himself stabbed out his own eyeballs might i recommend the iron pokers js,0
45,cbs 's threshold held the promise of a good thriller however regardless of it 's interesting story premise good acting and well supported production team it like nbc 's surface '' and abc 's invasion '' was cancelled although i considered it the weakest of the three mentioned it alone was told before production ended it was not being hence it had just enough time to provide an adequate series finale and why i rated it 4 vice 3 stars was it cancelled because the plot was flimsy or dumb possibly but it did offer better tv viewing than many of the boob tube 's reality '' shows and less than funny comedies was it cancelled because it lacked character depth and good acting maybe but carla gugino molly charles dutton blaylock brent spiner fenway rob benedict lucas peter dinklage ramsey and brian holt cavennaugh did a very good job trying to provide three dimensions to their characters sadly they did n't have the opportunity to finish the job was it cancelled because it did n't get the support it needed from the folks behind the scenes arguably but the team did offer some great visuals interesting plotlines and nightmare scenarios so why was this potentially promising series suddenly suffocated probably because it cost too much money and the average television viewer does n't appreciate a good story takes time to develop the alias 24 law order csi smallville numbers is it worth buying or renting yes though a cancelled series it has that one thing most of it 's one season wonders do n't have an adequate conclusion that does n't leave you wondering how a is to be resolved,1
46,astonishing you have to see it to believe just turn off the lights seat back and have fun and amazon delivery is realy great,1
47,this 1988 gore film i ca n't call it anything else since it 's not a horror film in the classic sense features an ensemble of treat williams most notably from the substitute '' series of movies and comedian joe piscopo known for his years on saturday night live and comedy impersonating the likes of frank sinatra and david letterman among others the two play cops williams is roger and joe is his partner doug the back of the vhs gives a detailed description of the film plus two pictures of some of the scenes in the movie lindsay frost plays the stereotypical innocent '' woman caught up in everything that 's going on around her but the corpse of the situation deals with roger getting shot and coming back to life he must solve a case within so many hours or he 'll turn into ashes and as the hours progress naturally we start to see his body fall apart literally darren mcgavin plays the part of an evil doctor vincent price plays in a scene or two and he 's revealed to be the mastermind behind the resurrection room at the dante lab he plays a guy named loudermilk who everyone thinks is dead the movie is gory and and it succeeds in being a good parody of the lethal weapon 'buddy cop ' films even though it probably was n't intended to be the first time around but that 's the way i view it and on that point the movie is great i give it four stars because of the gore and my personal dislike for films but those who like that kind of film will love this one it 's not so gore and so stomach turning it ca n't be seen several times like many of the texas chainsaw films are but dead heat '' is gory compared to other action films of this era starring charles bronson clint eastwood or mel gibson i give it 4 stars for the story cast and acting minus 1 star for the gore factor,1
48,i 'll admit that i 'm a to the madea '' series finally seeing this compilation at the insistence of my teenaged niece creator tyler perry and his the opinionated never lit by the way madea '' have starred in several successful stage plays and subsequent theatrical film versions to the delight of fans mostly nationwide though the stories feature the characters the belligerent teenager the devoted wife the straying husband the vixens the lotharios etc and situations infidelity promiscuity straying from the church comedic funerals obnoxious and overbearing family members perry 's productions also introduce a bit of spirituality with each story 's ending dependent upon divine intervention making things right some of the acting performances are a little over the top and the musical selections though sung with gusto and relish by the gifted vocalists are weak in the lyrics department however as a whole the respective productions are entertaining and inspirational perry has tapped into a market that is unconsciously ignored by hollywood and is having great success on both the stage and screen this compilation lets the viewer experience revisit those stage shows,1
49,i only give it 2 stars for the shower scene with the twins really bad acting and plot that makes little sense trying to be like the original movie but falls way short its just bad acting with stupid and mean characters not worth it except for the brief shower scene,0
50,filming the story of gloriana is a virtual guarantee of success for a production studio from warner brothers to bbc the virgin queen still retains her power to enthrall intrigue and mystify these 500 years after she came to the throne she was perhaps england 's last true absolute monarch and certainly one of its greatest if not most famous since the advent of film she has been one of the most coveted roles to play indeed few monarchs have been so closely chronicled save perhaps her own father henry viii and victoria she has been portrayed by some of the most brilliant actresses sarah bernhardt bette davis judi dench judith anderson miranda richardson flora robson cate blanchett helen mirren even quentin crisp and most famously and importantly glenda jackson and it must be said without doubt that glenda jackson 's elizabeth r '' is the defining portrait the most accomplished historically accurate and masterfully acted glenda jackson is elizabeth i reincarnate there is simply none better and likely never will be so now we have duff in the red wig for 230 masterpiece theatre minutes perhaps for the sake of revisionists we are offered a far less imperious monarch one who is both reactive the real one was and passive the real one was not duff is an odd choice no beauty like cate blanchett but elizabeth was known for vanity not beauty duff 's elizabeth with quivering lip and watercolor behavior seems filmed underwater and make for an undesirable monarch certainly not the gloriana of myth or fact where is her famous wit her coy manipulations her strong moral fiber her intense devotion to state and loyal courtiers left with glenda jackson i suppose this elizabeth is a simpering maiden or a crass hag and only then do we see bits of fire in the performance hag works crass manages simpering loses the whole impact a suavely elegant very attractive and distinctly healthy queen mary i opens elizabeth 's story no catharine parr no thomas seymour no childhood but is quickly dispatched just as well for she 's thoroughly mary was none of those things far better was the wonderful kathy burke in the blanchett version though she was a bit of a protestant caricature daphne slater in the jackson series was far more appealing and perfectly written elizabeth 's transition from prisoner to crown is possibly the greatest story of her long life no part of her history defines and creates her personality more than these years the abuse by seymour imprisonment exile and finally her accession unfortunately much of this key period is sped through the fatal flaw in the series is the decision to cast elizabeth mooning incessantly over robert dudley later earl of leicester here played by a childish petulant tom hardy there is no chemistry here he is pretty but vacant glenda jackson 's dudley robert hardy no relation that i know of is a bit of a fop but he knows his place in court and elizabeth 's heart their chemistry is clear this version of dudley is a bit ridiculous how he would claim the queen 's heart for more than 30 years is a mystery in this performance so is most of the casting what 's with the acrobat an egregious error in this production is the portrayal of suicide by dudley 's wife amy robsart whose death at 26 in 1560 remains to this day a mystery more time should have been spent on the wooing of elizabeth by the french duc d'alencon who very nearly came to be her husband again the 1971 glenda jackson version handles this segment masterfully all too soon and without sufficient explanation we become immersed in the historically key battle of wills and imprisonment of the impetuous mary queen of scots elizabeth 's cousin granddaughter of henry viii 's older sister margaret whose claim to the english throne made her a rallying point of catholics and a very real threat to elizabeth it was mary 's son james who succeeded elizabeth in 1603 founding the house of stuart far more attention should have been paid to the case for and subsequent execution of mary queen of scots which was elizabeth 's darkest hour forever bloodying her saintly propaganda likewise more attention should have been given to walshingham elizabeth 's master of subversion although william cecil lord burghley is given fair due the decisive armada happens much too quickly lessening its impact and giving far too much time to be spent on the stormy relationship of elizabeth and robert devereaux earl of essex portrayed by hans matheson who is cast and directed as a bipolar mama 's boy '' a very strange oedipal twist here whose hair look and even attire speak far more to 2005 than 1585. the entire second half of the production is brought down by this admittedly strange relationship here given a basketful of psychological issues left to the viewer to consider unraveling the casting is awful the acting mediocre the personality baffling this essex is a wreck blame the revisionist director two significant annoyances elizabeth 's duff 's accent is n't simply london which would be fine but stands in stark contrast to everyone else 's appropriate english diction and clarity she comes off as a guttersnipe and worse of all distracting to the utmost is the incessant soundtrack that dominates and not pleasantly the action and plot of the movie the sheer volume of it is horrendous to say nothing of the attempts at mixing courtly historical period music with essex 's electric guitar my suggestion here is to rent this one watch it as long as you can and then return to davis blanchett jackson or even dench overall a disappointment were it not for 95 historical accuracy and enjoyable period costumes plus the decent acting most of the problems are the director 's fault do n't blame the actors it would have earned one star but this queen is no legend and this cast is horrendous an inglorious gloriana,0
51,if playwright tennessee williams 's southern gothic writing style makes his works feel more ornately melodramatic than those of o'neill or his closest contemporary arthur miller they do provide resonant showcases for the actors inhabiting his characters this is clearly evidenced in this collection that epitomizes some of the most powerful acting to come out of hollywood in the 1950 's and early 1960 's all directed by true filmmaking masters probably because they are the least censored by the studio system at least in the form presented now the best of the set are elia kazan 's a streetcar named desire '' and john huston 's the night of the iguana '' the others are kazan 's baby doll '' richard brooks ' cat on a hot tin roof '' jose quintero 's the roman spring of stone '' and brooks ' sweet bird of youth '' a feral smoldering marlon brando justifiably made his reputation as brutish stanley kowalski in 1951 's a streetcar named desire '' and his animalistic charisma still leaps off the screen intriguingly one of the extras included in the set for the movie is footage from a 1947 screen test of brando when he was 23 and his stardom seems assured even then the plot of the movie amounts to the inevitable clash between kowalski and his visiting blanche dubois a fading southern belle on the verge of a mental breakdown having proven her ability to be a convincing southerner in gone with the wind '' vivien leigh expertly handles all the florid dialogue with her particular blend of defiance and vulnerability strong supporting work comes from kim hunter as blanche 's naive sister stella and karl malden as blanche 's seemingly respectful suitor mitch now over ninety malden is on hand to provide his own eloquent recollections of the production on an alternate track and film historians rudy behlmer and jeff young provide more objective commentary on another track film critic richard schickel 's 1995 look at kazan is the centerpiece of the second disk and there is also a more interesting documentary on the film and original broadway show the best portion focusing on censorship and the several minutes that have been reinserted in the dvd version of the film 1964 's the night of the iguana '' deals with a similarly dysfunctional group of people but this time the setting is a dilapidated mexican beach resort where reverend shannon newly defrocked has taken a group of spinsters from a women 's college huston made his reputation on his strong literary adaptations and his affinity shows in the fulsome characterizations striking visuals and dark humor richard burton is in peak form as shannon and there is also sterling work from deborah kerr as the spinsterish hannah and especially ava gardner as the slatternly resort owner maxine faulk the dvd contains a recent featurette and a vintage video both fascinating baby doll '' is an entertaining hoot that does n't seem as sensationalistic as i 'm sure it was when the film was first released in 1956. it 's simply a farce about the potential deflowering of a old child bride with a nice pouty turn by carroll baker in the title role and a surprisingly funny one by karl malden as her randy husband cotton mill owner archie 1958 's cat on a hot tin roof '' is far more vaunted but ultimately hamstrung by the overly careful portrayal of brick as an asexual protagonist this in spite of stellar performances from elizabeth taylor paul newman and burl ives newman is even better as gigolo chance wayne in 1963 's sweet bird of youth '' and he is matched all the way by geraldine page 's performance as faded movie queen alexandra del lago a role that would have ironically been ideal for ava gardner the weakest film of the set is 1961 's the roman spring of stone '' about an aging american actress living in rome who falls recklessly in love with an indifferent gigolo a decade after streetcar '' the leigh excels in the title role while a young warren beatty fits the physical requirements as the gigolo paolo even though his accent is a little too emphatic all four of these movies come with featurettes and original trailers and cat '' also includes commentary from williams ' biographer donald spoto the focal point of the eighth disc is a 1973 documentary tennessee williams ' south '' which highlights insightful interviews with williams in the new orleans area the film also includes classic scenes from his plays reenacted specifically for the documentary you can have the privilege of seeing broadway 's original blanche dubois jessica tandy and compare her work to leigh 's as well as an impressive turn by maureen stapleton as amanda wingfield in the glass menagerie '' this is an incredible film collection for anyone who wants to see some of the greatest performances of century american cinema,1
52,it is a pity that a wonderful picture is demerited by roger moore ' performance her 's good for a dandy in the continent but in this film he is not convincing at all he is verry debonnaire like he is just sipping tea in great the film becomes stiff and you do n't believe it the other actors simply try to do something like a farce it is a pity to see the great richard burton in such role eugenia lizald,0
53,awesome movie great for laughs and you do n't have to be high to enjoy it this is n't ghandi or shawshank redemption it 's not supposed to be the best movie ever made but it does give you the laughs so just keep laughing and stop taking it too serious,1

55,this review might contain some spoilers was disappointed with this anime after all the reviews i read i was expecting alot more it was slow in some parts and granted you knew somehow she would have to die considering her contract with a demon chrono she just all of a sudden gets a stigmata and it is pretty much over there was some humor but all in all i would not waste money on it infact i took my collection down to the local half price books and sold it the day after i purchased it,0
56,kings and queen '' is a bloated french drama that rambles on for an interminable two hours and minutes to no discernible point or purpose the film features two stories that seem unrelated at first but which eventually connect with one another about halfway through the movie the first centers around nora and her struggles with various men in her life including an elderly father who discovers he has only a few days left to live the other story involves a young man named ismael a violinist who finds himself placed unfairly he believes in a mental institution through the machinations of an unknown third party after traveling along on separate tracks for awhile these two narrative strands eventually come together when we learn that ismael is a former lover of nora 's and the man she has chosen to adopt her son from an earlier tragic relationship with a bit more focus and a considerable amount of streamlining kings and queen '' might have been a potent engrossing drama about modern day relationships it certainly has moments of tremendous insight and emotional power and the performances are for the most part complex and touching but taken as a whole the film meanders and maunders to such an extent that quite frankly it begins to wreak havoc on our patience and to wear out its welcome early on even more distressing is the fact that even though we spend what seems like a mild eternity in the company of these people we really do n't know quite what to make of any of them when the show is finally over for instance nora 's father on his deathbed writes a withering diatribe against his daughter 's character that simply does n't gibe with the woman we 've been looking at for well over two hours nora is admittedly no mother theresa then again who is but she certainly does n't deserve the invective thrown at her by her very own father nora could be accused of being confused indecisive a bit at times but evil enough to have her father wishing he could give her his cancer and make her die in his place i do n't think so perhaps this film is simply operating at a level of depth that i was unable to fathom but my suspicion is that even writer roger bohbot and arnaud desplechin would have trouble fully explaining their purpose here this is a well acted pretentious bore of a film that takes the audience on a long rambling voyage through a sea of personal crises a journey that leaves the viewer no wiser or more enlightened at the end than he was at the beginning,0
57,growing up i absolutely loved the turtles but this dvd stinks the only plus is that i can have the original episodes in convenient dvd form rather than track down a bunch of old vhs tapes this dvd is no different from the season one and season three dvd 's they all have spelling errors and title errors and each one seems to have been produce in a fashion just to capitalize on the new turtle 's sucess which by the way the new turtles are much better than the old ones on the season three dvd the package refers to bebop '' as bebob nice editing job i guess it was to hard to get that one right also all three of the dvd 's are bare bones with no special features the price does however reflect the crappy job the studio did on this most of these dvd 's can be purchased for around 10 bucks i just wish that peter laird had the rights to the old show so that it could have been done some justice on dvd,0

60,as i write this review it was 5 years ago this very day that the walt disney released the classic fantasia '' for the first time on dvd as a anniversary special edition but exactly 5 years later you can no longer purchase a legitimate new copy of it without paying at least double the original sale price via such avenues as ebay as a disney shareholder i am one unhappy camper ! ! this is the only reason i 'm rating this classic film with only 2 stars the dvd is no longer legitimately available without forking over at least 40 or 50 for a new copy when the original list price was well under 30 and that current price is only going to go up as times passes by i 'm sure i 'm not the only consumer that 's really sick and tired of disney 's inane policy of releasing and then quickly yanking some of their dvd releases so what am i supposed to do now wait another 5 to 10 years just to buy a legitimate copy of this dvd when disney finally decides that the time is right to release it again i think not ! i ca n't wait that long and my nieces and nephews will probably be too old to care at that point or should i instead pay an insane price now for an original copy the profits of which will not go to disney again i do n't think so ! i do not believe in getting ripped off and refuse to support those that profit from it regardless of fundamentals if disney insists on continuing their ridiculous and outdated practice of discontinuing some of their classic films on dvd after only 2 to 3 years of availability it should n't surprise them at all that they 're actually losing potential sales to versions of the films that are being sold around the world and from auction sites like ebay too the way i see it they asked for it ! ! by not making these classics legitimately available at all times they are encouraging piracy it 's that simple and they deserve it ! ! in this day and age people are not going to wait a few years to get something they want now ! ! i guess disney is forcing me to think about buying a phony yet much cheaper dvd version of the original fantasia '' just so i can show this classic to my nieces and nephews i 'd much rather buy a legitimate copy that 's reasonably priced but i ca n't because disney wo n't allow me to do so oh well it 's their loss a classic film like fantasia '' which came in at no 58 on the american film institute 's 1998 list of the 100 greatest american movies of all time deserves a far better fate than this great job disney ! ! way to go !,0
61,this was truly a great piece of work and should be viewed by all it was a very sad day when the election was stolen from gore but this movie gave me a new realization that being in office would have held this man back his talent and passion truly shine through here and are very contagious this is not a movie that leaves you feeling hopeless and wondering what you can do gore lists plenty of things we as individuals can start to do to make changes he gives a website for more ideas and info if you think this might be too boring for your taste give it a chance and watch it if only to see the giant jellyfish thank you gore and all of the people who helped you make this happen,1
62,in essence this is a texas chainsaw remake but here 's the difference and why it 's far inferior i do n't care one iota for the victims '' i can barely tell the females apart the guys are so obnoxious i look forward to them dying unlike texas chainsaw parts one and two horror masterpieces ! this movie shows the psycho family '' hmmm kind of like texas chainsaw far too much a little goes a long way too much overkill ! many plot holes and take away the music there was some really bad acting it gets two stars for the cool middle inserts in funky film style and also the one great sequence where the cops are killed but in general rob zombie should not get writing credit for this it 's texas chainsaw massacre only nowhere near as good,0
63,not only was the dialogue of the film trite and the plot much like a pornographic after school special but the movie unfortunately reinforces a worldview which groups been touting for years if you 're thinking turning your female frienship into a relationship do n't the lesbian always goes crazy and dies in the end if you 're interested in finding out what i 'm talking about lisa duggan explains how this ideology gets transimitted and reinforced in her book sapphic slashers also if you 're interested in watching a film about lesbian love please do yourself a favor and check out the incredible true story of two girls in love or but i 'm a cheerleader support movies that actually advance queer causes instead of making all of us look like freaks,0
64,hey genius good job ruining the end of the movie for anyone who has n't seen it like say my five year old and eight year old children it 's a miracle if i can even get them to sit still for five minutes and now that they know the ending to this film there 's no way they 're ever going to agree to go to bed tonight thanks a bunch ever heard of the internet before you must be a first time user,0
65,some juvenile delinquent girl gets in trouble with the cops she 's sent to gymnastics camp she used to be a sickeningly famous gymnast before she became a worthless slacker she thinks everything and everyone is really really stupid she does nothing but argue with everyone all the time it 's all her parents fault of course because she 's perfect her dialogue consists of nothing but remarks that she says in that oh so cute '' way that fans of lizzie mcguire may find clever good grief this is just beyond unwatchable even worse is the fact that the lead actress is 24 years old and yet her and everyone else in the whole movie act like a bunch of narcissistic 12 year olds it just grates on your nerves until you 're about ready to shove the dvd through the paper shredder,0

67,someone bought this dvd for my almost 5 year old daughter we thought the special effects would be fascinating and they were however within minutes of the movie 's beginning my daughter was in tears i wo n't say why but she found the plot frightening several times during the movie i tried to talk her out of watching but she wanted to see what happened in the end fortunately the movie is relatively short overall i found the story to be a cynical look at christmas as an adult i think it might be humourous to watch after a hard day of christmas shopping but i urge caution before showing it to young children there was way too much animated violence to match the spirit of christmas,0
68,this film is a real delight but it also has a message about our consumer culture do n't miss the deleted scenes i 'm sorry the director cut out the saints in the loft '' in particular what a powerful image ! but it 's there on the dvd so enjoy this marvelous charmer of a film,1
69,i did n't like this video for several reasons the rubber band is a waste of time and hurts your hands i was looking for an aerobic video i have gilad bodies in motion which is great but was getting bored with it since i had it for four years let me just say i 'm sticking with gilad because denise does nothing for me you do n't even feel like you had a workout with her she 's boring i would recommend gilad for aerobics and tamilee webb for toning tamilee is awesome i have many of her videos and i 'm a true fan of hers,0
70,this workout was very hard for me to get into i became very bored by it the moves were challenging but the routine was blah if you are a beginner this is not for you you are better off purchasing quick fix stability ball workout '' no matter what your level of fitness,0
71,office space '' is a very funny comedy many parts of the film were a delight in the beginning when everyone is stalled in traffic i knew the feeling working at initech corporation as a computer programmer makes for one dull job in the life of peter gibbons ron livingston besides having a job he hates he is enclosed in a cubicle as everyone else is then there is his boss lumbergh an arrogant jerk life for peter gibbons is just one boring day after another that is until he decides to go see a counselor at the suggestion and demands of his then girlfriend while undergoing hypnotic suggestion the psychologist dies of a but peter is now a changed man he no longer cares about his job and says whatever 's on his mind and his boss lumbergh gets a healthy dose of this new peter when peter learns of the impending layoff courtesy of john mcginley and his partner at initech corporation he decides to hatch an idea of ripping off the company with a computer virus his two fellow and friends are only too happy to go along afterall they 're part of the layoff 's and on top of that the company men want to make peter a supervisor this film is funny on many levels with jennifer anniston as the love interest of peter and the character actors that make up the film it makes for an enjoyable watch jennifer anniston 's character and her dealings with her boss and his flairs '' are also funny this is a highly recommended comedy i 'm sure we can all relate to some of the funny scenes that are played out in the film between peter and his boss lumbergh and the character of his boss lumbergh is delightfully hilarious especially the way he talks the whole movie is very funny and wonderful highly recommended,1
72,despite managing to give fleeting impressions of importance and quality this film is a complete the long '' scenes wedding russian roulette etc are much discussed usually either in the context of being essential for character development '' or boring '' in fact they 're a delaying mechanism behind which the filmmaker attempts to hide his lack of storytelling skills once he does try to move things along awkwardly jumping without explanation or exposition from one bloated to another you can see the reason for his procrastination despite being desperate to give the impression of profundity and truth he really has nothing to say the actors go a long way toward diverting attention from the film 's awkward vacuousness by giving false and impressions of character and narrative but this falls apart whenever the filmmaker attempts to make anything happen '' 2 stars is rather generous but de niro walken and company deserve some recognition for some good acting albeit for such a misguided cause ultimately despite some controversy many of the film 's questionable portrayals of vietnam vietnamese america americans and war are to be condemned more for their cinematic silliness than for their historical inaccuracy,0
73,cesar milan the 'dog whisperer ' bases his training methods on a dog behavior model that is so out of date as to be archaic from the dinosaur age he teaches that dogs base all their behavior on their pack status and that you need to use painful 'corrections ' to convince them that you are alpha this idea has n't the slightest shred of evidence going for it yes dogs do have dominance roles but that has n't the slightest thing to do with problem behaviors dogs do 'bad ' doggy behaviors because they work dog guards his food bowl dog wants to keep food and knows that growling keeps you away dog pulls on the leash dog wants to get somewhere faster and knows that pulling speeds things up the dog does n't care whether or not you 're alpha he only cares that what he 's doing works to get him what he wants technically cesar 's methods work but they use force fear and pain to teach the dog when you can teach the same things faster with the proper positive motivation and techniques i have three hyper active highly driven border collies and they 're all very obedient and mannerly they do n't haul me around the leash nor do they leap at guests nor do they ignore me when i tell them something and i do n't need to be 'alpha ' to get them that way neither does anyone else i strongly suggest that you do n't buy this item good books to start with are karen pryor 's 'getting started clicker training for dogs ' melissa alexander 's 'click for joy ! ' also with a great problem solving section and jean donaldson 's 'the culture clash ' you can easily have a happy obedient well behaved dog without causing him fear and pain,0
74,my kids just love this movie barbie in the 12 dancing princesses it is a very clean movie it is not scary except for the mean duchess but she really is n't scary just mean it teaches about honesty and family and how they care about each other which is really good for children to see plus it was entertaining and a whole lot of fun to watch,1
75,a solid addition to the rockumentary genre this captures sting as make his foray into solo work with his first solo album and a band of jazz superstars looking back it is obvious that sting was meant to have a solo career and arguably he was solo with the police at the time of this movie it was not so obvious and the suspense around how he will fare is interesting the music is super the behind the scenes look is interesting and his band of jazz luminaries adds richness,1
76,okay the script is not the most imaginative i 've ever seen but i like the actors especially ben 's best man so i was friendly with this movie for the most part i did n't even mind the obvious holes in the plot such as why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones or at least why do n't they use them oh no much more plausible that ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for 150 to buy a car to drive to nc i did n't even mind the fact that the whole we 're married and my husband 's a doctor '' charade was so predictable oh gee he 's pretending to be a doctor and he 's on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people d'ya think someone might have a heart attack and holmes '' might have to step up and uh they 're pretending to be married and oh ! surprise there 's the best man and maid of honor ! d'ya think they 're gon na get busted what killed it for me was that ridiculous ending it was obviously supposed to be a surprise and it was but there seemed to be no other reason for it than to pull a fast one on the audience i felt cheated i spent the entire movie getting emotionally involved with the relationship between sarah and ben and i really cared about how they would handle things with the fiance and sarah 's little boy and all that i cheerfully became disengaged from the relationship between ben and bridget i totally believed neither one of them was ready to get married or right for each other the film spent an inordinate amount of time showing me they 're not right for each other and that this wedding was not meant to happen right up to the last moment we think he 's breaking it off with bridget instead what the heck let 's just go ahead and get married after all huh he left sarah sitting out there waiting for him in a hurricane ! ! ! after making her promise that she would still be there when he got back this man obviously does n't have a clue what he wants in life and i 'm expected to believe they lived happily ever after not only that but what does it teach us about taking this commitment seriously it teaches us that if our instinct is telling us do n't do it ! '' and our genitals are yearning for someone else and even mother nature seems to be working hard to prevent this marriage aw heck go on ahead and do it anyway it 's just marriage it 's romantic ! you could get lucky and live happily ever after ! it 's been my experience when things are n't feeling just right as you approach that wedding turn and run the last thing you should do is close your eyes grab your balls and take the leap,0
77,an absolutely wonderful film by clint eastwood thelonious was an amazing man he said things on the piano that we wordsmiths are n't able to communicate his unusual character made for an interesting subplot this film is footage of the man himself usually playing his music i 'm just sitting here being stunned,1
78,murrey is a middle aged man with a comfortable living standard and the emotional life of a turtle which does not keep him from chasing women and from appearing like a regular don juan '' to his neighbor winston a family man murrey gets talked into visiting 4 women whom he knew 20 years ago searching for a possible son whose existence is unclear and who may just be a hoax the visits are all shocking in different ways all women live in similar locations though on different social standards between white trash and professional wealth all encounters are odd the safest one is the visit to the grave of one woman who has died in an accident she was number 5 in the list of suspects '' for the mother of the phantom son do n't watch this film if you need action or a plot if you are happy with smart dialogues odd situations great acting a script worked to perfection this is one for you,1
79,i love asian movies i like them because they tend to be more cerebral and less politically correct than the garbage coming out of hollywood these days 2047 however was the first asian movie that i failed to finish becaase of the sheer boredom of the plot do n't get me wrong the main actor clark gable is an excellent actor and the babes were gorgeous but the movie itself imo is overrated you can argue art '' all you want but if you like an endless stream of a playboy making girls sad it may be for you not my bag at all i kept hoping the movie was over at several points only to my god it 's not over ! boring,0
80,this is a wonderful movie to keep the kids and quite possibly yourself entertained during an holiday i laughed i cried really i did and i just really enjoyed it,1
81,stagecoach '' is significant along with destry rides again '' for redefining the western for adult '' audiences director john ford achieved that by emphasizing character developement over action though the film does contain some thrilling sequences for sure the film does contain a number of western archetypes the gambler the prostitute with a heart of gold etc but they transcend the stereotypes stagecoach '' is also significant as the film that broke john wayne to mainstream audiences wayne 's entrance as the ringo kid is the stuff of legends there is not a bum performance in the impressive cast that includes the underappreciated claire trevor as the social pariah dallas and thomas mitchell as doc boone for which he won an oscar the film 's status as being historically significant is not debatable as first class entertainment it is timeless,1
82,the criterion collection a continuing series of important classic and contemporary films is dedicated to gathering the greatest films from around the world and publishing them in editions that offer the highest technical quality and original foundation of the collection is the work of such real masters of cinema as renoir godard kurosawa cocteau fellini bergman tarkovsky hitchcock fuller lean kubrick lang sturges dreyer eisenstein ozu sirk bunuel powell and pressburger the criterion collection must feel embarrassed for wasting a tremendous amount of time in this glorious package to glorify the most incompetent of all filmmakers i did not watch any of the extras but i hope you can find there those hilarious clips from the with welles crying like a baby '' oh they only let me do the movie i wanted to make in kane,0
83,i practically fell asleep while watching this tape the girl doing the exercises is n't even saying anything while she 's doing it it 's a voice over ! also she 's all alone in a blank room all the exercises are basically the same i would suggest mtv pilates it 's a lot more fun,0
84,the details are all fine if you do n't know the middle east but are not well researched and inconsistent i wo n't bore you with the list all the big picture takeaway is that the middle east and big oil are a complicated business with many parties that have a big stake tell us something new the overall storyline does not have much else going for it i was expecting more intrigue a more synthesized story line a disappointment,0
85,do n't bother just do n't bother it 's sad to see,0
86,the reason the original iron chef '' was such an awesome show was entirely due to the bad translation and over the top voice acting therefore without these elements it becomes a pathetic charade of the original program i was at one time a hardcore cult fan of iron chef '' because of the hilarious voice overs and true foreign zest of chairman kaga and the gang i really did n't care much for the cooking or whatever food was being prepared the real heart of the show was the voiceovers and the mad zesty zeal with which the japanese chefs went over something as inane as cooking i loved iron chef '' in much the same way as i loved the original mystery science theater 3000 '' they were both quirky tv cult shows that gave a certain sense of community among their hardcore fans this new show really does n't cut it in any way shape or form i 'm not being unpatriotic or anything i 'm just saying why this new show is so weak also i noticed that once the translators of the original show started figuring out the show was a huge hit they ruined their own voiceacting by being all self concious the original few seasons of the first iron chef '' are where it 's at ! once again i do n't watch this show for the cooking i watch it for the odd bizarre translations and cheesy voiceacting,0
87,i just finished watching when harry met sally for probably the tenth time it 's been years since i 've seen it and i enjoyed watching it with a new girlfriend i could n't get over the fact that i still laughed several times almost as if i 'd never seen the movie before my interpretation after all these years was that the movie showed how people and relationships evolve over the years and how this movie realistically depicted couples going through the paces of petty arguments infatuation etc without stooping to sugary sentiment i took harry and sally as unique individuals with their human quirks that made them more lovable i did n't see them as somehow representative of all men '' or all women '' then i watched the extra documentary on the dvd which i had never seen until now big mistake my new interpretation '' of the film was suddenly cast aside as i remembered that i actually did n't like this movie as much when it first came out over time i had grown to accept the fact that i could still like a movie and its characters without actually agreeing with what they said or how they behaved what i had forgotten was billy crystal 's rob reiner 's director and nora ephron 's writer agenda that these two characters actually were supposed to represent the genders gag the views of the characters are presented as if they were fact men supposedly always think about sex and ca n't be friends with women most if not all women have faked an orgasm all men are clueless to the fakery and so on i can only hope that these dinosour views are only representative of the boomer generation and older folks no one on this film is even close being a member of gen x because this does not represent the reality of all humans you 'll notice in the documentary that they only interview people above the age of 40 to prove '' their case if they 'd interviewed an empowered 25 year old woman maybe she would have let them have it no i wo n't fake it if he sucks in bed i 'm going to tell him '' and as for men some of us younger ones are actually perceptive enough to actually know when the woman does fake it none of this changes this classic film that 's the great thing about art it 's open to interpretation i can watch this film and define it my way two unique and funny people who took a long time to get their act together and fall in love otherwise i 'd hate this movie but i wo n't give reinder ephron et al that much power just because they were narrow minded about gender roles does n't mean i have to be about their film if you agree with the characters in the film by all means watch the documentary but if you see the movie as being about two interesting characters pass it by do n't let a dvd extra taint your pov,1
88,in this set of episodes the battle city is down to the wire my favorite character marik not yami marik is the center of the events most of his character is known in this set it seemed almost if yugi was only a for a while even though i dislike dub this was still good enough for me the scene when marik talks to his brother for the last time or so he thinks at that moment is one of the most beautifully drawn of any anime i 've seen if only the voice actor sounded like marik 's age for once and kept the poignant music and did n't use the gold stuff when someone 's mind is snatched and also a shame is that the ishtars wo n't appear for many episodes after this with such a simple exit,1
89,yes this is a supernatural psycological thriller but far from a good one as far as i 'm concerned i love these kinds of stories and i went to see this film with a lot of excitement first because it has a interesting subject second because it has a great actor i thought denzel washington would never associate himself with a bad script but i was wrong but denzel is always top notch the rest is n't by now you already know the story a good detective a killer who happens to me a demon who happens to pass from person to person just by touch the hunt blah blah blah the script is idiot from page one the killer as we will see as the story develops travels by simple touch so excuse me why does n't the killer passes to a guard as he is going to be executed i mean the guy is sooo powerful and mobile that i find it unbelievable that he gets to be executed in the first place but ok let 's give the screenwriters a break somewhere in the middle of the film the demon enters a cat ok so he can enter all kinds of animals fine later on the main character learns that in order to defeat the demon he must kill his body in a place where there is nobody around his brilliant idea the forest full of animals was i the only one who did not know the ending before it came want more in an interesting twist the protagonist kills an innocent man and later on his own brother and no one will believe the truth ! how is he gon na get out of such a mess in the world of storytelling there are only two ways of getting out of such an impossibly difficult situation either the screenwriter is brilliant and finds a believable way to save his character from the master mess built by the screenwriter himself so he should know ! and then we get some sort of positive ending despite everything or something deep inside the protagonist fails and he loses the battle against evil despite the fact that there was a way out first line of solution die hard the fugitive second line of solution chinatown we have none of that here instead we have an evil god against a simple man great starter for drama right but the man gets weaker and weaker and weaker and the demon gets stronger and stronger to the point where we get the fact that the demon is invincible long before he actually wins and the great turnaround never comes obviously we all hope he will be defeated and that 's why i kept myself seated all through the film because if there was a way out it would be brilliant if the character dropped the towel it would be thought provoking to say the least but no the ending was easy and predictable the screenwriter could not achieve one of the two possible lines of solutions he wrote the first thing that came to his mind and hid himself under the story ends bad '' label without any depth every villain has a weak point it is up to the hero to explore it may he loose or win the only problem the hero faces here is a stupid lack of data we have the data the moment the demon enters a cat that 's why we know how 's gon na end what about the girl who helps denzel what about his nephew should n't they be part of the ending too do n't come with the this is an '' kind of talk ! do i sense a smell of desire for a sequel quick ! gas masks ! ! ! ! or as would write quick watson the needle ! '' despite a stupid screenplay denzel is always great,0
90,i bought this dvd to replace a worn video from the bbc british broadcasting commission it was a bit of a shock the original film has been edited and chopped up with bits of rubbish added through it also now has a poor voice over the whole feel of the film has been removed all the pbs and viewers like your rubbish where 'd that come from it was totallly funded via the bbc the pbs editions mess up may have been funded by someone else my copy is going free as i wo n't be watching it again sincerely do yourself a favour and source out a bbc edition i give it 5 stars it is an awesome package inspiring and well told something to watch again and again hence i 've worn out the video cassette,0
91,what a disappointment ! every time it gets hot it cuts straight to the end the movie is entirely foreplay ! !,0
92,the danny boyle directed trainspotting '' was a somber view with some comedic overtones into a group of scottish heroin addicted losers while the film garnered accolades i found it to be profoundly disturbing as the seemier side of addiction was vividly depicted ewan mcgregor playing mark renton and his crew which included full monty '' star robert carlyle as violent psycho begbie swing back and forth between kicking the habit and falling back in love with allure of a scag high congregating in a filthy deplorable shooting gallery the gang is shown in graphic manner getting high as a group they 're abhorent of authority and employment and motivated only by scoring their next fix mcgregor attempts to kick the habit by locking himself into an apartment with needed supllies remembering the constipation from a previous attempt he goes out to score suppositories in a humorous scene cramps force him to use the filthiest toilet in scotland into which he drops his precious suppositories he then dives into the disgusting toilet to retrieve them mcgregor eventually does clean up complete with cold turkey induced horrific hallucinations escaping to london and working as a realtor his buddies follow him there and reel him back into the life mcgregor and carlyle and two other buddies eventually have their dreams come true big drug deal they manage to complete the deal for pounds which mcgregor decides to steal he intends to use the loot to start a straight and clean life anew fat chance,1
93,okay the only real extras on the dvd is a theatrical trailer for the film and some biographical information on the movie and it 's stars but warner gets a five star rating for great picture and sound and the option of both standard full frame and widescreen versions on one disc ! ! ! this movie is an absolute classic ! ! ! and it 's great to have it on dvd ! ! ! one of the great men in chains '' films ! ! ! the great cast includes paul newman george kennedy in his oscar winning role ! wayne rogers strother martin joe don baker ralph waite and many other classic character actors ! ! ! two thumbs up ! ! ! five stars ! ! ! a,1
94,i was very disappointed in this dvd it was a dvd for someone who wanted only the very basic information on birds the dvd was very short and could have added a lot of expanded details the ability to view details of color and details of wing tail bands etc would have offered a much better learning tool it also could have had the bird call longer throughout a longer display of bird colorations,0
95,this film itself deserves 4 stars at least im givin this a one cause its a bootleg i tried to play it in 3 different dvd players to include an and it would not play then when i finally got it to play it looks like one of those copies that got transfered from tape to disk and it looks and sounds like if your into purchasing like that then i guess this is for you i advise you to cop this movie somewhere else,0
96,the story line was very moving anthony hopkins and morgan freeman are always fantastic in any movie they do it is well worth the price and well worth the time to watch,1
97,for years i 've bemoaned the switch from film to digital video for horror movies but i 'd rather watch anything shot on video than watching the waste of film that is dead life do n't be fooled when i say this movie is shot on film it seriously looks like it was shot on a camera it 's perpetually grainy dark fuzzy and shaky and not in an artsy way my 200 video camera looks infinitely better than this the video quality is appropriate however as it 's matched in wretchedness by every other facet of this the sound is murky and undecipherable the acting is strictly amateur hour the characters are with no distinction or purpose the story is the dialogue is a completely worthless bore there 's nothing remotely scary and the special effects including a couple of computer effects that look like they were made on a commodore 64 are laughable or at least i wish they were laughable that would 've at least made for some sort of enjoyment instead of the utter torture of this high school student film it 's movies like this cheap and devoid of any real effort to uphold the horror legacy but which get cherry spots on blockbuster shelves because they 're packaged with slick cover art that give horror movies in general and zombie movies in particular a bad name and that make horror fans so wary disgraceful !,0
98,i generally like some of these because they 're usually pretty erotic jane fonda 's role in barbarella comes to mind this gwendoline series definitely had the potential what with the theme and the scenes involving gwendoline with her dominant girlfriend but the very beautiful tawney kitaen cast as gwendoline apparently balked at doing scenes this was 1984 after all and so the producers obligingly did n't force her to do any and as a result this one turned into a very bland weak and diluted version of raiders of the lost ark it 's not a good adventure film and it 's certainly not erotic there 's a little nudity and some ridiculous moments that are supposed to capture the kinkiness of the french comics but overall this one was a disappointing bust,0
99,the bad i ca n't say i dislike this item but i did not like it either even though i 'm still a novice golfer score between and been playing for about 18 months i 've read a lot of golf fundamentals articles and studied like 4 other dvds yes i 'm an instruction junky and i can say that this instrutor simon holmes misses to point out many important fundamental factors that influence a good swing and even though i like how the dvd has a well structured lesson category listing he does not explain deeply enough on many things the filming production seems to have a good intention for this dvd but it lacks camera on the ball clubhead ball lies and graphical enhancements for better understanding of what he want 's to explain i mean with today 's technology on dvd production this seems to be a cheap one the good he has very good tips on many subjects that i think they 're transparent for a very beginner if this is not your first instructional dvd and just want to gather a new bunch of tips then buy it otherwise a better selection that i can reccomend for a complete golf school dvd is the wally armstrong 's ultimate golfing experience the set is very cheap because it 's a compilation of old and from that instructor and from the 5 dvd 's in the box you can thrash 2 if you like but for 17 bucks hey ! ! is worth it ! i hope this helps and saves you some money,0
100,john lennon and his wife yoko ono were guests on the dick cavett show three times in 1971. their first apearance was taped on saturday september 11 1971 and was john 's first interview after the beatles had disbanded the subsequent interviews were taped on friday september 24 1971 and thursday may 11 1972. viewers beatle fans and their counterparts will undoubtedly enjoy the natural conversational flow among dick cavett and his guests john appeared to be in his element happily chatting with the famous talk show host it was a good thing john rightfully defends yoko during this interview and makes it quite plain that she did not break up the beatles she has been wrongfully blamed for something that was bound to happen naturally after all the individuals who made up the beatles needed to move individually grow develop their own individual styles the group could not last forever cavett gives john and yoko equal time he listens to them attentively takes them seriously and at no time criticizes anybody or speculates about anybody it is very easy to forget the interviews are taking place before a studio audience as viewers are easily lulled into the flow of the conversation yoko is very animated during this first interview she smokes chats easily with her host about her undergraduate days at sarah lawrence and shows a film she made john and cavett are actually funny sharing some humorous observations about clothing and coiffure be sure to get this dvd collection it is funny interesting serious thought provoking and memorable this is something for everybody and not just beatle fans yokophiles and lennonophiles the bonus dvd will certainly bring many smiles to many faces,1
101,just as a note that 's the japanese title there 's something about this movie that i 've always liked i 'm not sure what it is but being a pokemon fan of course i like it the movie have always been great and this one has something that i really like about it the movie starts out in the north pole with a scientist named lund his friend yuko and his son tory there is suddenly an explosion and tory is trampled by a frightened pack of walrein and as they say after that all heck broke looks a meteor is the reason for the explosion and the creature inside the meteor is more than your average pokemon deoxys a rare pokemon from another planet woah more than one niiice the strange creature carrying a rock with a gem inside is suddenly attacked by the large rayquaza a frequenter of the ozone layer so what the heck is he here for ah so rayquaza feels threatened by deoxys and so both pokemon break out in a rather spectacular pokemon battle with some pretty cool background music might i add so professor lund flees with his colleages and son four years later a young pokemon trainer named ash ketchum along with some friends enter the high tech city of la rousse and as fate would have it tory 's hometown and well i wo n't spoil it from there the plot is good and deoxys ' 'destructive ' intentions are less cruel than one would think do n't worry folks no angsty here also rayquaza brings some nice battles into the movie his fights against deoxys are totally awesome the soundtrack is also great i really love the music played during the opening scenes of the movie and the fights between rayquaza and deoxys the animation is very spiffy shiny bright and new SMILE i have n't had the pleasure of watching the original japanese version of the movie but when i do i 'll tell you all about it 'kay well i guess that pretty much wraps things up oh yes tory 's afraid of pokemon due to the whole 'get attacked by a herd of walrein ' thing heh okay then sayanora faithful readers !,1
102,yes i thought the whoppi disclaimers were absurd how many generations have grown up with these cartoons and now all of a sudden they 're bad '' i never saw disclaimers on cbs when i watched these cartoons on saturday mornings for years and years ! ! ! but aside from that my main gripe is the organization it would be better if they 'd organize these into eras i 'm not as big on the leon schlesenger era from the as i am on the and would rather these be organized chronologically not that i do n't respect those early shorts for what they were i just like the later ones better regardless as long as they keep releasing these i 'll still keep getting them since cartoon network and nickelodean have completely removed them and decided that the new generation of kids do n't have the attention span '' to appreciate them i beg to differ my kids love looney tunes ! and replace them with garbage full of toilet humor which apparently is ok by the pc police,1
103,george sluizer 's original version of the vanishing aka the man who wanted to know offers one of european cinema 's most quietly disturbingly anonymous and everyday sociopaths feeling his way one step at a time towards murder if you 've seen that version you probably still ca n't get the final revelation out of your head but the film had plenty more to offer than that playing with chronology subverting the usual cliches of its 'lady vanishes ' plot the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive and throwing in some excellent characterization i can only assume that for this 1993 us remake sluizer was so determined that else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work his career never recovered chief culprit is an astonishing performance by jeff bridges that has been overthought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level a friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing and this film is the proof of the pudding every movement is overly mechanical in its precision making him look like a rusty clockwork toy while his voice is a bizarre mixture of tootsie latka gravas from taxi and a dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from no banality of evil here just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying please let me kill you thank you for your consideration ' but the blame really needs to be shared out here none of the performances are good often they do n't even look good keifer sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station nancy travis flounders badly and sandra bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession not that they 're given any help by either director or writer todd graff the script is particularly weak the chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film worse is the rush the film is in draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next rather than the mood shifts in the couple 's relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he 's probably better off without her as for the new and improved happy ending standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame 's end on a joke like a tv cop show ' moment best not go there which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie even a shockingly bland and uninspired jerry goldsmith score ca n't do anything for this one,0
104,it is nice to see bebe neuwirth in something other than cheers oscar aaron stanford is too sophisticated for girls his age but not for his stepmother sigourney weaver and bebe neuwirth the seductress women are all over him his stepmom ignores him and chiropractor thinks she finds the romantic she 's always dreamed of the joking innuendos are quite hilarious reminding me of the graduate gary winnick the director shot this movie on a digital camera in two weeks and won raves at the festivals the little captions before or after a scene kinda tell you how oscar is working or getting worked over john ritter dad apparently serious but funny and the whole cast gives strong performances certainly earning their street creed you 'll find charming nuggets of truth in this movie quite a bit of wit and hilarity sure oscar is 15 and rather than opening his eyes to girls they open his his daydreams about his stepmom are electrifyingly filmed as for the morality i think people are a little paranoid over this taut striking film if you are openminded you 'll find this film is more about coming of age than what narrow minded people think it is a light film to the touch and men will probably be reliving high school fantasies about the older woman women will like it because it shows how men are nothing more than putty in their hands it is just amazing how much depth this film has in 77 minutes ! rachel alice hunter chairwoman teardropfilms entertainment corporatio,1
105,this recommendation is for the uncut version of leon the professional a well crafted tightly edited excellent story that makes you wonder where the time went when the end credits roll an action film that can be appreciated by those who generally do n't care for the genre the character interpretation and interactions alone are worth it if you 're looking for something worthwhile to watch check this one out,1
106,i have always enjoyed watching this movie with so many great stars some whom are no longer with us never owned it on video now i have it on dvd great price too ! ! it was worth it,1
107,what do i think of when someone says disney ! '' hmmm kiddy films girly stuff princess groan we do n't need more of that ! dreams come true and cheesy yep all of the things above are in ice princess with some fresh twists with the mean rival '' changed to nice rival '' and add with hard work '' after dreams come true '' i mean look at sleeping beauty and cinderella what did they do to make their dreams come true which is a pathetic one to marry a prince one had a beauty sleep and the other had a to make her a nice dress with a flick of the wand ! casey carlyle was totally different i agree with people that it 's impossible that she can become that good in such a short period of time which is one of the reasons i give this film a 4 and not a 5. but it 's an improvement the cutting of the skating scenes are beautifully done and while people on imdb say that they 're to showy it is true but aww come on this is a movie not a real competition and everybody likes some nice in movies the acting is great especially michelle trachtenberg and hayden panettiere michelle 's acting is really good and you can see the gradual transformation from geeky to graceful in her movements hayden panettiere 's acting is also good but it 's a pity that her character is somewhat bland and '' ish '' ish would mean that she 's almost perfect she 's smart good at sports and extremely popular also it is very unfair because on the page i 'm writing this review on it says ice princess widescreen edition cusack i know she and kim catrall or the ones with fame and do n't mistake me the acting is good but casey and gen completely steals the stage and in the place of joan cusack it should be the names of those two the soundtrack is wonderful especially reachin ' for heaven and no one delicious songs ! and reachin ' for heaven is currently competing with forty something other songs for a place in the oscar nominations list good luck,1
108,this movie is worth owning it 's a classic tale well done and very entertaining,1
109,ok so it may not be in the league but it 's a great movie particularly for those who are involved in scouting my scouts think it 's too funny,1
110,this is a sad little gem of a movie i really liked that the plot explored more themes than just romantic love the story had as much to do with issues of identity community and fidelity in my opinion there were a few technical and narrative flaws that kept the film from attaining the level of greatness that it should have achieved especially when considering the quality of the performances the slight quiver in weisz 's voice was right on target as was perez 's accent the rest of the illustrious cast was more than capable considering the type of story and the setting i ca n't help but think that a would have been a more appropriate treatment than a feature film i emerged from watching the movie with a feeling that there was a lot more to explore beneath the surface of each character,1
111,paul newman plays a private eye and gene hackman and susan sarandon are a couple with a dark secret too implausible too many overdrawn secondary characters a rental at best,0
112,normally i love documentaries i 've watched hundreds of them and with one exception i have loved them all however outfoxed is the single most boring film i have ever seen a relentless rant against rupert murdoch 's cable news station this film could possibly interest someone who is singlemindedly obsessed with fox news but i can not imagine that anyone on earth is interested enough in fox news to remain awake while watching this movie watching outfoxed makes me realize what a genius michael moore is whether you love him or hate him whether you agree with him or not you have to admit his films are entertaining this film however is a major bore regina mcmenami,0
113,kiefer sutherland stars in heat ' a crime drama in which the star of hit tv series ' can show more tender side of the character than he is often associated with he plays pally boston cop who is forced to retire because of the heart problem and his acting is very good overall however there is not much that i can recommend in heat ' except some nice touch in showing the characters the film tries to include as many things as possible but few of them really materialize the story looks rather like a familiar one because of his early retirement pally starts to drink and even thinks of committing suicide his relationship with his estranged wife charlotte rhada mitchell is not going well and he is not happy to know that she is now going out with someone else but charlotte is also nice and caring so she persuades pally 's brother ray anthony lapaglia to visit him ray who is accused of not being a citizen by his too earnest brother has a good plan to make money easily and offers it to pally it is about buying a racehorse cheap he says and it is an easy job because he happens to know that the horse which has not win any races recently is actually misdiagnosed only suffering from a polyp a small operation can remove when everything is going well things get suddenly complicated because of a jockey tony lothaire bluteau from here the story snowballs into blackmail caper and even murder but the film 's overall tone is always light not taking itself very seriously unfortunately for all their effective acting from sutherland lapaglia mitchell and bluteau the weak and unsure direction totally fails to give momentum to the otherwise unremarkable film it is not funny when it tries to make us funny and it is not romantic when it tries to be romantic feeble direction simply misses several good opportunities to make good use of the jockey 's sullen little daughter sam kay panabaker her feature debut who could have been a little surprise or gem in this unconvincing plot it is true that kiefer sutherland shows in heat ' another side of acting talent which is less eccentric and intense than most of the roles he had played or he would play that is good news and the only good news here,0
114,this is a really scary movie i 've always put on the top mantle as being the scariest horror movie ever but this movie surpasses that movie i did n't expect much seeing the title of the movie which does n't sound scary at all but was i wrong dead wrong if you are a horror fan you got to see this movie the terror one feels stays with you even after the movie ends cold chills ran through my bones and the hair never stopped standing at the back of my neck asian horror movies do n't rely on gore but suspense and an ever so thickening creepiness that never stops contemporary american horror movies do n't scare me much anymore and it often relies on the same old tricks asian horror movies like this one which is korean is not an original idea but the craft of scaring the living daylights out of you is getting stronger and better other asian titles i recommend are dark water and the red shoes,1

116,the movie directors in the me particularly iranians are responding to demands by the west for certain type of movies they produce what is demanded from them in turn they receive awards cultural industry empowers these demands they are the ones who will ensure that such movies will be received the western audiences and they are the ones who decide who is awarded there is no single me movie which depict the story of western imperialism in the me and then awarded for doing so me movies must show that me women are in need of emancipation me cultures are presented as in need of getting civilized civilization itself is presented in vertical sense there is a civilization somewhere out there all measterners are expected to reach yet it was that same civilization that threw doll bombs on them no reference to who threw them doll bombs or who mined their country who deprived them of education and knowledge the west is represented by beautiful blonde nurses a nice american guy who just pretend to be a doctor and help them with his everyday western knowledge of medicine '' in the midst of total ignorance and the helicopters that threw on them fake legs such a nice way to civilize ! the story of afghanistan is real however the movie does not render a fair job in reflecting the background of it rather it does an excellent job in meeting the cultural demand in producing a product that can sell well the situation is miserable but what caused such misery in afghanistan your answer after seeing the movie will be that it is islam it is that islamic culture that backward culture of those people with wonderful eyes such a conclusion is strongly demanded in the absence of other factors there is no single implying in the movie a smallest reference that afghanistan has suffered centuries old imperialism at the hands of the british and then the russian and now americans who played their great game on the chessboard of eurasia there is a passage in the movie to the effect that somebody will come to liberate them those imperialists came in the name of civilization french did to algeria the british did to india all in the name of bringing them civilization it was white man 's burden to do so yet makhmalbaf needs more awards he has to compete in the cultural circus and perform well for the pleasure of western audiences in order to continue to be in demand you did a nice job applauses go on anyone who is interested in cultural imperialism should read foucault 's works and edward said 's orientalism,0
117,probably the best place to start for bergman initiates three decent films although i think through a glass '' is in a different class to the other two features moreover they all form a useful overview of the progression of bergman 's art from circa 1960 to circa from the religious torment of 1961 's winter light '' through the conjunction of interpersonal conflict and religious neurosis of through a glass '' to the explicit focus on familial relationships of the silence '' the latter reminiscent of bergman 's 60 's output in short although there is nothing to match the astounding persona '' 1966 the films do give a great indication as to bergman 's filmmaking in particular and the whole boom in euroean art house cinema of the early in general dvd excellent criterion transfers the documentary disc a swedish film about the production of winter light '' is excellent as well worth watching alone for bergman 's casual conversations on his religious torment he speaks of spiritual angst in the tone most people speak of going to the shops for a loaf of bread,1
118,there have been emblematic films that plainly justifies its success based on serious denounces that attempt against the environment but few times we had had the opportunity to watch with such boldness the ferociousness constancy and dedication like this one we should be back to the times if silkwood or the china syndrome to feel with such powerful intensity the importance about the magnitude of the ethical limits of the industrialization and the preservation of the environmental health that degenerated in an unpredictable scandal of majuscule proportions on the other hand of the coin and i must confess i have never been a special fan of roberts she displayed by far the best of her repertoire and gave us a very real portrait that deserved her the academy award that year one more thing in order to the fairness i would personally would have stated decreed an equal number of votes with another superb and perhaps never equaled performance ellen burstyn and requiem for a dream '' and that i keep this statement taking into account that famous double prize between barbara streisand and vanessa redgrave in 1967 where the difference in what acting concerns was even major excellent edition and magisterial direction of steven soderbergh,1
119,this is a pretty good collection for the mickey beginner i would n't purchase it however if you already have the walt disney treasures mickey mouse in living color '' series because all the shorts are on those dvds as well,0
120,'the sword and the sorcerer ' released in is a mixed bag of positive and negative the negative the production values are marginal the picture quality overall dark and grainy the dialogue does n't fair any better it 's also dull and uninspired as for the storyline well i found it extremely uneven with some parts of the movie excruciatingly slow and others quite good the positive lee horsley is surprisingly engaging as the vagabound warrior prince talon and kathleen beller is breathtaking as princess alana she 's never looked better the film is worth at least one watch just to see kathleen in her prime there are also numerous other very lovely ladies such as anna bjorn in this production that will keep all the young male viewers interest peaked cast includes richard moll george maharis richard lynch simon mccorkindale and robert tessier one of the great tough guys in film,0
121,this dvd exposes the ultimate warrior as 25 postitive and 75 negative i do believe that jim hellwig does suffer from narcissm in relation to his ongoing identity crisis just another case of a wreslter who could n't seperate himself from the character and even still till this day as he is retired give speaches to colleges the only thing that bothers me is that jim hellwig was n't involved in this dvd to give his perspective and opinions he was offered to participate and again offered to make his story heard before and after the fact jim hellwig declined used it as another opportunity to initiate a lawsuit this guy did make an impact in the wrestling world but it was too shortlived fans can chalk it up as a cool memory but unfortunately not one linked with any high level of respect like we can with flair piper hogan and the most respected of all the undertaker,0
122,this movie is an insult to merely bad comedies gee another movie with a black guy hello eddie murphy who because it 's perfectly fine in pc hollyweird calls charlie sheen and everyone else who is not black a host of nasty names the movie is a mess let 's see the protagonist tucker plays a con men who after being falsely suspected of being a is chased around by cops and the bad guys the mcguffin is a sack of diamonds sheen is supposed to be a but like most of his other movies he sleepwalks through it clearly this movie is meant to be a vehicle for tucker the sceenwriters were obviously making it up as they went along first screenwriter '' '' hey bob what will we have tucker do next hey i know let 's have a car chase and have him call some people some names '' second screenwriter '' hey great idea fred i sure do n't have any ideas '' apparently there are many people who think this guy is funny even though the movie is a of murphy the trickster flicks basically the plot is tucker runs around dodging bullets and calling everyone a name if that 's your idea of humor i pity you,0
123,this movie still rocks after all these years since it first came out an excellent and energetic movie from the start plot is cutesy it serves as a vehicle for the wonderful selection of songs and dance sequences however i think this version of the movie is missing a few scenes i would rate this movie version with 5 stars had it been unedited to me if memory serves me did n't alex receive a letter from her friend hannah when alex discovered hannah passed away is n't there a reconnection at the end between mickey and alex 's girl friend whom the latter was dating was n't there more of a story between alex and her boss if this version is cut in anyway i prefer getting the complete and unedited version i find this version incomplete somehow but jennifer beals looks terrific and one wonders why she did n't star in more movies for her generation,1
124,this as you may have already read was a very intimate little show made to promote morning view the live footage is as good as it gets and the sound is flawless to boot this dvd really gives you a good idea at how amazing incubus is live most all of the songs sound as if it was the band merely pretending to play while the studio version plays over the speakers every song is a favorite of mine and i absolutely love the way brandon mixed things up on pardon me plus the little comments brandon makes in between songs is a nice little touch i still watch this after having it over a year and find little things that i never noticed before which makes this that much more sweet the bonus features are splendid as well if you watched everything this dvd has to offer it would take up about of your day probably there 's that much on here just a few of the extras that are crammed on here are a couple of jam sessions of various songs brandon recording warning a lot of this song is a capella and incubus showing how funny they really are the original cut of the wish you were here video is also on this which is pretty humerous a few of the best songs on here are pardon me the warmth warning new skin and nice to know you as amazing and funny as the special features are the standout is really the performance i ca n't find any words that would do this show justice i guess you just have to see it and judge for yourself,1
125,absolutely unwatchable so silly it 's very nearly offensive it 's like watching one long music video by a rapper full of dumb beautiful women buff ghetto thugs and jokey cars without a doubt one of the worst movies i 've ever seen the script is laughable the acting worse vin diesel and paul walker are more dumb and dumber '' than butch cassidy and the sundance kid '' awful,0
126,i really wish that people would stop trashing this movie for being unbeleivable and that it is so long it hurts to sit through it etc i have watched the film 4 times and have not had a problem with the length the movie is about a giant gorilla ! it is a fantasy film kids ! the original is one of my favorite movies and there is plenty to laugh at in that one as well i think the remake is incredible it better than the original in some ways yes ! in some ways no ! thats the way it goes ! i still love the new one and the original and both deserve to be in everyone 's movie collection ! i wish peter jackson would try to remake son of kong into as good a movie if he can pull that off SMILE,1
127,sexy funny and addictive i ca n't wait to buy season 3,1
128,i saw this movie a while back only because the family of the girl i was dating at the time was watching it and therefore was forced to sit down and watch it too to this day i pray i do n't ever have to sit through 2 hours of crap that trashes the reputations of the average again as a who has worked hard to take the right road in life i was disturbed at the storyline of this wannabee classic do we really need to come out with a movie for all of america to see that shows a negative side of the mexican race prison sex babies drinking beer young kids doing a drive by mexicans killing innocent blacks and vice versa please ! ! ! ! wake up ! we need some positivity ! ! ! ! ! edward james olmos said he made this movie because he wanted to send a message what message that doing the things shown in this movie are bad i think we knew that already ! what surprises me alot is all the positive reviews on amazon that this movie got this of course means that no matter how much sense i have made it is more than likely that no one will find my review helpful us not forget that i am not the only one who thinks negative about this film several consultants involved in this film were murdered by individual s out there who found the movie offensive edward james olmos himself was the center of threats following the release of this movie adios amigos ! ! !,0
129,jude is a very powerful film it is also very disturbing but it is absolutely a must see this is an adaptation of thomas hardy 's last novel the film is n't exactly like the novel but if you can ignore that then you 'll find that this is quite a terrific film just do n't expect exactly what you got from the novel over all i give it four stars,1
130,i just whant to say this if richard dean anderson is out of the stargate series so am i and that 's it ! if i could i would give this 0 stars but you ca n't not what i know anyways still teal'c daniel and carter is in the storie but hwo knows for how long,0
131,this line spoken by julie christie to dirk bogarde in darling '' just about sums up my feelings towards this movie although i am halfway done with this movie i think this is one of the most boring films i have ever seen and i am stopping this movie when it gets to the scene where christie looks at herself in the mirror as she removes her clothing i am done with this movie believe it or not and it only got worse christie 's character diana scott marries an italian man who hello is old enough to be father ! and oh yes he 's an aging prince in what had to be a ripoff of what happened to grace kelly and what would happen to jacqueline kennedy and the announcer in the newsreel that calls her princess diana '' almost made me laugh that nearly made me grab a gun and shoot my tv a la elvis presley considering that this is the same setup that occurs in georgy girl '' and that is spoiled british girl living in swinging england marries older man three words anna nicole smith also i would like to know what are these reviewers smoking in saying that christie deserved the oscar for best actress she did n't at all because it should and i mean should of gone to julie andrews for the sound of music '' my pick for the best movie of the 1960 's because not only did she overtake her performance of mary poppins '' for which she won the oscar she pulverized every performance by a female that year including christie and there 's a problem with the academy they ca n't seem to pull the trigger in giving oscars to the same person i 'm not alone in this arugment in danny perry 's book alternate oscars '' he picks andrews for best actress of 1965 and states that the reason why the ampas gave the oscar to christie was not because it was 'the british invasion ' but they saw it as a way to give an oscar to christie 's other film doctor zhivago '' which was 's rival and added to the fact that zhivago '' had no acting nominations there 's another oscar problem they do n't know when to be hip also does it seem like dirk bogarde and lawrence harvey were the two worst actors in film history because it seems to me that every movie that i have seen with them are bad weather it was this movie or the manchurian candidate '' with harvey or modesty blaise '' with bogarde in conclusion i think some moviegoers should change their mind about buying this movie because this has to be the worst performance ever to win an oscar or as what bogarde said to christie a fitting way to close this review since that i end where it begins i do n't take taxis that are filled with whores !,0
132,i own many of the 50 packs of movies and i must say i like this set very of these movies are from the 30 's and 40 's the hayday of movie mysterys the transfers are ok but not great and some of the movie have sterotype 's of all kinds just keep in mind when they were made and if they bother you do n't watch a nice set and a great way to build your movie collectio,1
133,these movies are just as great as i remembered them ralph macchio was hot in the skinny but he pulled it off pat morita has got to be the coolest neighbor ever and watching the karate kid ii reintroduced me to a great peter cetera song the glory of love so rock on ralph macchio peter cetera and pat morita oh yeah hilary swank get 's in on it at the end to,1

135,for what purpose these lies about the life of this man are the liberal film makers racists who do n't believe that there is a good black man to depict on film so they have to lie if someone wanted to write fiction about a badass black fighter on the cusp of super stardom who is framed for a murder then be my guest hurricane carter is not and was not that man facts in the movie denzel washington is shown in military garb with more medals on his cheat than colin powell they want to drive home the point that here was a man who served his country and is now about to be screwed by it fact is carter was kicked out of the army after being court mashalled 4 times ! in a title fight scence with an italian american fighter named giodello carter is depictied as beating this man pillar to post only to be screwed out of the decision he so richly deserved fact giardello deserved to win that fight according to the overwhelming number of experts who have viewed it then and now on tape the depitction is another lie another lie is this notion put forth in the movie that hurricane was on the verge of getting that title before mean white bigots framed him for this murder fact is that carter 's boxing career was going down hill and he had only won 8 of his last 15 fights as carter 's boxing career failed he became more militant in his political views and hated white people while in prison he was diagnosed to be psychotic yeah a psychotic racist is the model for black america shame norman jewison must not think much of black folks to make a movie of lies like this denzel washington should be ashamed he participated in such trash those who produced this trash bet that the average public would be gullible enough to believe these lies with no attempt at knowing the truth and hollywood did n't care they just like the message looking at these reviews i have to say they made a good bet america bashing and race baiting is alive and well earning oscars and making for big box office a shame,0
136,this is one bad movies i am a devout horror fan but i was unable to find one redeeming point in this movie the acting is worse than bad it 's a joke the plot is so far beyond lame as to be ridiculous save your money even the cinematography is utterly unimpressive there is no humor no likable characters not even a decent quote or one liner by the time it ambles toward its pathetic excuse for a conclusion you will wishing you were in a theatre so you could demand your money back so save yourself disappointment and keep looking this movie is the biggest bomb i have stumnbled across in years,0
137,a movie starring shelley long and bette midler as two women in love with the same guy when they learn that he 's used '' both of them they turn from being mortal enemies to closest friends as they chase the louse from new york to new mexico silly and dumb with the usual chase fare thrown in everything is a cliche from the opposing personality idea long is an orderly midler a loudmouthed mess to desert hippies to car chases etc etc the movie seems to go on endlessly,0
138,i guess i expected more out of this movie but i confess i was mildly disappointed in it at first the movie seems to be having a hard time making up its mind whether to be a comedy or a drama and the resulting mish mash is a bit unsettling still it was a great cast dean martin was particularly adept at westerns much more so than frank sinatra who pretty much plays frank sinatra in this one it is fun to see the two of them compete for the ladies in this case anita ekberg and ursula andress the bad guys are well represented by victor buono and charles bronson a fun movie but not particularly memorable,0
139,the lack of liam neeson and raimi 's directing is what ruined this movie for me while vasloo is superb in his taking on the burden of the liam created character and drake always has appeal the movie as a whole needed a much better script it was too predicatble too phoney on the bonus side they did manage to keep the hapahazard and crazy comments darkman makes during chases and fight scenes in tact so that was a plus,0
140,i go to abs classes frequently and wanted to get this dvd to help mix up my routine and give me something to do if i did n't want to leave the house i was a little disappointed in this dvd i love self magazine and their workouts and the amazon reviews made it seem very promising the routines are broken down into four separate workouts the only one that involved any effort on my part was the section as for the rest the other sections would have you do too few reps i felt to get your muscles warmed up let alone reshape them i think this dvd is great for beginners its simple enough to follow and it wo n't scare you away too soon but if you 're like me and you workout on a regular basis and just want a new routine this probably is n't the abs workout for you,0

144,i could barely get through the um er reimagination of the childern 's classic while the set design and special fx are state of the art as usual for a tim burton film the actual movie is hard to watch why depp 's performance '' is chock full of ticks and mannerisms flat and finally rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 gene wilder version burton 's film is more horror than fantasy often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare while deliberate on burton 's part that does n't make the final product any more watchable it 's one grim dismal downward spiral slog not much holidday fun huh as with most of burton 's other big expensive failures he knows how to create a convincing world but has no clue how to populate it with characters and situations we identify with could care less about the final result is a film that 's like a fragile hermetically sealed curio on the shelf nice to look at from afar but hard to get attached to much less involved with what a waste of millions of studio,0
145,csi miami having evolved with difficulty over the first two seasons reaches its high point in season 3. anyone who has watched the show realizes that horatio unlike gil grissom or mac taylor is the true star of the show the rest of the csis are entertaining but the show is truly about him this dynamic when combined with the glamour and glitz of the miami setting and crimes most foul make this for me the csi that is above the rest plotwise season 3 is bit over the top issues covered in this season include a stalker murder a sports star on trial for his wife 's murder a young woman killed in a club the murder of a uniformed cop gang warfare in a hospital the killings of irs agents speed dating that ends in a death spree killing and the murder of a wingwoman some of the lesser episodes involve our old friend clavo cruz a giant boa contricter that eats a woman skaters and gamers and of course the infamous tsunami episode the season incorporates the raymond caine subplot heavily in the last 5 or 6 episodes this leads up to a satisfying conclusion in the season finale the season is also one of change a regular cast member gets killed in episode 1 which quite frankly was quite a relief since the character was terrible another regular not a csi kills himself a new cast member joins officer ryan wolfe makes the transfer from patrol to csi and making some waves in the process callie and delco who has very little to do this season have a tough time dealing with tragedy and we actually see horatio dating a rather attractive assistant da at least for a few episodes some old familiars pop by including suzy and madison and raymond caine 's killer bob who ends up being much more important in the story than we assumed all in all it adds up to a great season which will be extremely difficult to top in season 4. people either love or hate this show so if you count yourself among the fans this is a must addition to the collection corwin m,1
146,season 1 of millennium '' featured fantastic performances from its cast and a dark atmosphere that made the '' look sunny by comparison unfortunately much of that year ended up as little more than a murder mystery of the week '' fare thankfully the second season supervised by former '' producers glen morgan and james wong changed all that the second season began with the suspenseful 'beginning and the end ' where frank black pursues the mysterious polaroid man who kidnapped his wife this episode also introduces the comic relief for season two computer hacker brian roedecker even though 'the beginnning and the end ' would fit perfectly in season 1 the subsequent episodes follow a different path that greatly improved the series starting with the second episode 'beware of the dog ' and continuing with episodes such as 'the hand of sebastian ' 'owls ' 'roosters ' and the haunting season finale 'the fourth time is now ' we find out that the millennium group has existed since the beginnings of christianity and is n't nearly as altruistic as frank black and the viewers originally suspected in addition to the millennium group storyline we also learn more about frank 's childhood via two holiday episodes 'the curse of frank black ' a tale where frank encounters the ghost of a neighbor who committed suicide and 'midnight of the century ' an emotional story of frank trying to mend the relationship between him and his father in the latter we find out that frank was not the only one with a strange gift as his mother was with the ability to see angels lastly the second season even showcased two comedy episodes 'jose chung 's doomsday defense ' and 'somehow satan got behind me ' these hours of television are completely different from the average millennium '' episode to say the least but they 're still worth a look nonetheless i could continue rambling on and on about the greatness of season two but you 'll really have to buy the dvd set and form your own opinions the dvd set does come with some bonus features but the only one of worth is the season two documentary turning of the tide '' the rest of the bonus materials are at best,1

152,this movie has recieved several bad reviews and i can understand that this movie is a rather complex movie and not the typical first gay love movie '' but if you like movies that are not this one if a must have the movie is not a hardcore sex movie in fact there is only one scene of sex in the movie the positives of this movie are it uses silence as a tool and it looks into a differnt kind of first love one that does n't turn out in the same way other movies portray again i only recomend this movie to people who enjoy complex movies and are not looking for just hardcore sex,1
153,i was not into this movie at all my mother recommended it to me but it was lame all the way through a man decides he wants to do something different with his life so he takes a dance class ofcourse there 's a fine dance instructor a crush is pursued a wife gets jealous hires a detective and his crush is found out the movie was too predictable and it just was n't for me not a bad movie just not my cup of tea richard gere was cute as usual which was the only thing that made me watch it to the end besides wanting to know what a correct quick step looked like since so you think you can dance '' never had contestants who mastered it,0
154,any movie that begins with a civil war ironclad going down a river with guns blazing is going to appeal to me although my wife thought i have started playing the wrong movie then again it was really upsetting at the film 's climax to see the texas getting shot up yes i know it is just a film but the thought of finding such a civil war artifact intact only to have it immediately start getting shot up momentarily took me back to the real world which is a mistake because realism is not the name of the game here sahara '' begins at the end of the civil war as the confederate ironclad texas escapes from a burning richmond carrying the gold supply of the confederacy it disappears into history where the lost ship becomes the latest obsession of dirk pitt matthew mcconaughey who believes the texas crossed the atlantic and ended up somewhere in africa do not ask how '' because an explanation is not forthcoming and you know from the title of the film that dirk is right on this score dirk is partnered with al giordino steve zahn and if you pay attention to the title sequence you get a visual tour of their career resumes technically the boys work for admiral ret jim sandecker william macy who has a hard time reining them in once dirk finds another clue about the texas meanwhile eva rojas penelope cruz of the world health organization has arrived in africa with a team to find the source of a dangerous plague that has been spreading across the region however there is another problem in that rojas is getting too close to the truth which puts here in danger from the local dictator general kazim lennie james and his partner smarmy french rich guy yves massarde lambert wilson dirk becomes involved in this because he is making a habit of rescuing eva and because he is looking for the legendary ironclad in the same part of the continent al is along for the ride as if rudi gunn rainn wilson for part of the way these narrative threads are used to connect the action sequences that are the main set pieces of this 2005 film from director breck eisner thoughtcrimes '' the best of these is the speedboat one involving the panama '' which comes relatively early in the film i want to ask whatever happened to saving the best for last '' in a film like this but it is not like they did that in raiders of the lost arc '' so why should that happen here granted sahara '' is not as much fun as that classic film romp but it was certainly more enjoyable than national treasure '' probably because it is not as burdened by american history and national landmarks as that one and mcconaughey and zahn both look buff enough to pull this stuff off in the world of movie reality besides i like a film where the chemistry between the two guys is better than the chemistry between the hero and the heroine mainly because if this film is the start of a dirk pitt franchise you know al will be back but you have to expect a different female lead in each subsequent film i especially liked sandecker 's third demand at the end of the film and to tell the truth knowing nothing about the original novels i would much rather see the team in action than dirk teaming up with somebody new in each film for me the end result is that sahara '' is an enjoyable action romp of the brainless variety but if you want more then look elsewhere,1
155,ok sue me i love this piece of cheese from the 70 's a remake of sorts of the last man on earth heston is a doctor who used a expermental sereum on himself after a bio war has wiped out most of the world the people who are left are albinos who ca n't get out in the sun vampires as they were in the book and they want heston to die for his crimes he is free of the germ and was an army doctor so they blame him for the end of the world heston spends his days tracking them and killing them and his nights whole up fighting off the mutants this was a staple of late night and for some reason the sunday afternoon movie you can tell in the stunts that it 's not heston and some of the speachs are well corny but the movie even with it 's down beat story is fun and can be scary for younger kids still i would be very careful about letting young ones see it as it has some nude scenes in it the widescreen transfer is very good as is the sound and the extras are small but very nice,1
156,i feel this movie should be seen by all it 's awesome and really makes you think you get very attached to the characters and feel what they are feeling i highly recommend it ! awesome movie,1
157,the beginning is very well done then the only interesting parts are the between jude law and ed harris the rest of the film is bad i 'd say luckily i recorded it from tv it is now erased by the way one of the amazon reviewers who also disliked the film wrote that bob hoskins is american he 's from england,0
158,establishmentarian michael moore is mad as hell and he 's not taking it anymore as his smalltown america flint mi has just lost jobs as greedy exects move plant to mexico and put above mentioned thousands out of work moore does a good job of keeping the subject serious for a change other good moore films included fahrenheit 911 and the big one others he 's done get too far into his leftist politics which i am am not into good job here michael,1
159,this is billed as a thriller but there are hardly any thrills it would have benefitted from some judicious cutting to make it a little leaner the shaky camera work detracts from some decent scenery the politics of the film contain no subtlety or shades of gray i can almost see a couple of college sophomores hitting the bong and sitting down to hash out the script liberal student who has no clue about the real world 1 and then she discovers the evil corporation has been testing bhlswhncatrw 2 interrupts evil corporation '' why are you being redundant the only plus for my wife and i was the acting which was great fiennes was especially good underplaying his character in the early parts of the film resulting in a character with depth and nuance i only wish the rest of the film was worthy of the performances contained within it,0
160,i loved this movie for those who gave it one star i guess didnt see how well it was done in the american version all it sarah michelle gellar 's face the japanese version was much better considering it was original and made more sense it has alot of characters in it but not so much that u will get lost in all of them since they usually die or just dont appear until later in the has some twists which are american leaves out soo sooo much in the american one it was basically a dead girl killing random people in the japanese one it is touching because the whole time the ghost was reaching out for help anyway i recommend this to anyone who loves asian horror and likes a good plot and movie ! ! go see it ! ! and enjoy,1
161,definitely a great movie rules of engagement brings to the screen two stories as they unfold simultaneously that of a military investigation into whether an officer in the marines was in violation of the code of conduct during an incident in yemen and the inner struggle of the lawyer as he tries to come to terms with his past and the ghosts that have been haunting him ever since vietnam the film combines drama action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind needless to say tommy lee jones samuel jackson and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances which are outstanding to say the least ! all the actors without exceptions give it their 100 and it really shows the chemistry is amazing ! the plot the setting the dialogues the special effects and the music are all wonderful ! in short it is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection if you have n't already done so ! ! strongly recommended along with black hawk down a few good men and courage under fire,1
162,i have been a casual fan of the radio version of prairie home companion '' for decades although i seldom listen to more than 30 minutes of it at a time usually only if i am driving somewhere on a saturday afternoon when it is being broadcast i read seven or eight reviews of the movie before getting around to seeing it and while most critics kind of liked it there were a few grumbles however i thought the film was excellent and the fantasy sequences which bother some people were needed to cut down on the sweet and nostalgic elements that bring the radio show its steady fans i liked all the casting too robert altman is not a favorite director but when he is good he is very good as in and nashville '' when he is bad he is terrible but here i thought he done good same with garrison i trashed his recent novel in an amazon review but i liked him in this,1
163,in good company '' goes on and on at the end a little bit and the ending especially is not fulfilling if it had ended minutes before it actually did i would give it three stars instead of two i admit there were quite a few times when i laughed a bit to myself but it did n't make me fall off the couch or anything there were other times when i thought the actions of some characters were weird or forced overall it is n't an entirely bad movie but like i said the ending is unfulfilling overall not strong performances coming from scarlett johansson or topher grace,0
164,both sides of disc 5 are unplayable all others are o,0
165,i would love to see the cast of this movie dressed up as hot dogs and thrown into a cage with star jones and marv albert,0
166,i am a bbc devotee and officionado and purchased this dvd sight unseen because it seemed to ooze of excellent epic bbc storytelling and visual feasting however i was only partially correct it is excellently produced and beautiful to behold but the story is depressing and even a bit silly i left the film feeling robbed disappointed sad and a bit unfulfilled i viewed it only once and then sold it on at a price do yourself a favor and save your time and money,0
167,love the movie but the quality of the dvd put out by alpha video was so bad it was very difficult to watch the sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up if you do n't want to be disappointed and feel like you 've been ripped off wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one,0
168,calling all black sheeps of the family '' it is never too late for your family to come around in this simple yet powerful story april and her mother learn that sometimes those we have the most conflict with are those who are most like us painful as it seems we must all come to terms with dissapointment and overcome our personal fears of rejection when revealing our true selves,1
169,warning spoilers opening scene is quite shocking some graphic effects there is more male nudity and male genitalia than female there is only one quick very quick female genitalia shot near the beginning or end '' of the movie since the movie begins with the ending scene '' and ends with the opening scene '' the rape scene is violent with graphic language obviously actual penetration is achieved anal but none shown not even a good boob shot you of course '' see the male genitalia big deal ! movie is revenge driven and that seems to be about it does n't have a great script may be good to the french but not to us standards movie is in french with english subtitles,0
170,director gary fleder cast michael douglas sean bean brittany murphy skye mccole bartusiask guy torry jennifer esposito shawn doyle victor argo conrad goode paul schulze lance reddick famke janssen running time 113 minutes rated r for violence including some gruesome images and language every fall hollywood trots out their latest thrillers attempting to cash in on the college crowd who wants to bring their dates to a dark theater and take advantage of the squeamishness of the content on the screen there is a hidden connection in the biting of nails and the changing of the leaves yet without fail every year there are enough thrillers to keep manicurists in business nothing sums up the quintessential fall thriller quite like do n't say a word '' a suspense romp as routine as they come diverting enough to fool you into a good time do n't say a word '' makes one wish for a leap in time to the holiday oscar contenders already nathan conrad michael douglas is a successful psychiatrist with a beautiful wife famke janssen and a cherubic daughter on thanksgiving morning a group of bad guys lead by patrick koster sean bean break into nathan 's apartment and kidnap his daughter what the men want is a jewel they lost 10 years earlier in a botched robbery that is being held in a secret place by elisabeth burrows brittany murphy a mentally unstable young girl rotting away in a hospital since nathan seems to be the only medical professional she trusts patrick uses him as a pawn to recover the jewel nathan is soon at the mercy of the kidnappers but as he gets deeper into elisabeth 's mind he realizes the young girl could be helped after all it 's perfect casting to place michael douglas in the lead role as no one could play yuppie paranoia quite like he can douglas has perfected this type of performance into an art form with his work in fatal attraction '' and a perfect murder douglas is a little more subdued than normal in this film as his aging seems to be wearing away his ability to play the hot rich stud who gets in over his head the film does contain many moments of pure distressed douglas his forte with his hair glistening teeth clenched and his eyes scanning the room etc douglas at least in the first act of the film makes an attempt to carry the picture with his expected bag of tricks soon enough director gary fleder places too much narrative nonsense on douglas 's shoulders and the actor eventually just gives up and lets the genre 's conventions take him to the safety of the end credits director gary fleder is no stranger to the fall thriller game having directed both kiss the girls '' and the rollicking things to do in denver when you 're dead '' not really an imaginative director fleder nevertheless can be counted on to get the job done with do n't say a word '' fleder is n't working with a particularly good script so he falls back on what has worked for him before this plan of attack from fleder leaves the picture stale and overtly familiar the film is not interested in adding new elements to the plot to keep things at least appearing fresh the end result making do n't say a word '' more boring than exciting the thriller which is set in new york city uses the city and apartment locations well creating a nice sense of claustrophobia it is when the action suddenly leaves the confines of the city and moves to a cemetery in a nearby island that the picture loses quite a bit of tension and interest moving to an cemetery ruins the fun of seeing the character freak out in their narrow apartments and office spaces the film must end with a clichd showdown which is the reason for the move to a different location but fleder makes a big mistake taking the story away from the grip of the big bad city the one element that fleder does get right is the casting of actress brittany murphy a powderkeg of emotions murphy is the perfect choice to play the deranged elisabeth murphy is a grand talent where is her emmy for her voice work as luanne platter on king of the hill '' and the only actress in hollywood that truly achieves success as both a tormented patient and a cute little princess just married '' uptown girls '' unpredictable and bristling with untapped passions murphy makes a vivid impression in do n't say a word '' you 've seen this type of film before and just because it 's the time of year when apples taste the best does n't make this barely alive thriller any more enjoyable for fans of the genre do n't say a word '' is another solid installment in the michael douglas versus new york crime saga just do n't expect any surprises,0
171,i thought this movie was pretty good i 've seen a lot of nicholas cage movies the rock con air etc so maybe i am biased towards him i 've watched this movie 3 times and it does n't wear thin too quick like some movies,1
172,i 'm sorry folks but i went into this one with high hopes given the outstanding reviews from both critics and laymen it would be a tremendous understatement to say i was disappointed this film is horrible in nearly every respect but this is the film 's fatal flaw a character study '' is no good when the characters act in a manner which is counter intuitive and against the grain of human nature the film portrays two convicts on death row as likeable guys who are willing to help out with this ridiculous standoff because they have no other choice sorry to bring up the obvious here but the only thing any person would care about in that situation is escaping he would not be with helping defend the police station he would have immediately shot the cop upon being given a gun he would not be worried about his chances out there '' remember he 's on death row he would be concerned only with escaping immediately sorry to all you fans of this cult classic '' but a movie in this vein must be at least somewhat realistic to gain my praise this one is a mess,0
173,teenagers plan a mock crime for kicks on the same day criminals knock off a bank for real and their paths cross i can understand implying that two have or had a homosexual relationship but to lace an entire movie with cheap and to stoop so low as to give a lead male character a female first name is a trifle ridiculous ok director we 'get it ' all men are secretly gay ! you made your point move on ! i ca n't even imagine that a person of same gender orientation could possibly find this film the least bit interesting much less stimulating for an intelligent crime caper with a subplot see bound '' since this movie is supposed to take place in wisconsin they give the locals a southern accent an absolute bore,0
174,it 's a ritual for my 5 year ld daughter and her dad to watch samurai jack before bed back when she was 3 and it was played on cartoon network they made sure to watch it together now that cartoon network is retarded and they do n't play it anymore i 've bought seasons 1 and 2. i just wish it was played on cartoon network like it used to be jill henrichse,1
175,julia roberts plays ed harris ' young new wife susan sarandon plays harris ' does not like new wife new wife does not like 's cutsey but bratty kids make new wife 's life a living hell thinks new wife is a stupid bimbo new wife thinks is a nagging battle axe new wife and fight and yell at each other ad nauseum how does the film solve this conflict is diagnosed with terminal cancer everyone reconciles and new wife suddenly love each other the end this is one of the most cliched saccharine hackneyed and shamelessly manipulative pieces of garbage put out by hollywood in the past decade if you like julia roberts susan sarandon or ed harris please see erin brokovich dead man walking and the right stuff and run screaming from this nauseating cinematic catastrophe,0
176,trapping a group of unsuspecting strangers in a house with no exits is not a new concept they did it in saw ii house on haunted hill and then there were none and i 'm sure quite a few others but that plot seems to always work it does for me house of 9 is no exception it does n't follow a storyline that 's predictable even though the plot is not unknown there are surprises suspense thrills and tense moments believe me you wo n't predict the ending i was very satisfied with the movement of this film it 's an interesting watch,1
177,i bought the dvd with this artwork out of a dollar bin and i got what i paid for the image is fuzzy and the audio is of poor quality this must have been taken from a print it may be that this film is in public domain so it may be difficult to find a decent quality dvd there are many issues of this film so you would do better to try one of the other dvd issues note amazon seems to spread these reviews across dvds of the same title so you may see this review under multiple dvd releases of meet john doe '' the poor quality dvd that i bought has a cover that looked like this,0
178,when i am watching a 1984 movie i am not expecting to see an oscar calibur portrail full of twists and turns some may call it predictible but myself i feel that the story flowed and made sense too many times have i seen a movie wher its certainly unpredictable because the plot climax comes out of nowhere tom sellek plays the part well and is very believeable as a hardened and some what cynical cop gene simmons in one of his only noteworthy film performances takes his kiss type persona and plays the evil genius well i for one enjoyed this movie alot and unlike blade runner did n't find myself watching it 5 times to understand the very shallow story line if you are looking for a believeable near future story pick this up,1
179,sat down and saw this one on televion only good service was that now i know buying the dvd would be a waste of money what was actually achieved by the british is portrayed as an american achievement slanders the men portraying them as heartless marauders other than allied propoganda pieces there are no incidents of machinegunning people in lifeboats the movie itself i have little respect basicly plotless and unrealistic action scenes unbelievable characters two dimensional this film awful,0
180,almost unbelievably bad except i saw the remake of 'shaft ' which should have been a forewarning this is like a comic book for filmgoers no not a graphic novel adapted to the screen more like a comic book for kids that you 'd be embarassed to own at any age doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack a travesty to the nth degree,0
181,had just enough tasteful sex to satisfy and oh yes the movie was good too,1
182,i did n't find this dvd too bad to watch but i would n't watch it again it had tons of good artists but i dont wan na have to sit down and watch a whole bunch of interviews i think this dvd needed a lot more action of rappers on the streets or somethin just my opinion,0
183,this 's modest budget is attested to by the fact that while most of the action is supposed to take place at a large state prison this prison only seems to house about 12 inmates the plot is that old but reliable one about a man posing as a prisoner so he can go undercover '' and solve a crime the crime in this case is not especially interesting and it 's resolved in much too pat a fashion however leading man tommy lee thomas looks good with his shirt off though he seems too small to be throwing his weight around and there 's a torture scene modeled on the one in lethal weapon '' in which he 's hanged by his wrists and zapped with electric shocks thomas ' performance may not be of oscar caliber but he does know how to yell,0
184,mighty quinn '' features a young sexy denzel washington xavier quinn as a smart detective who did a stint with the fbi and returns home as police chief on a carribbean island there 's a shadowy plot involving bills a guerilla movement and guns but the movie focuses more on quinn 's conflicts because his childhood friend is suspected of a grisly murder and quinn 's own discomfort from having made good '' but ending up caught between two worlds white and black he 's also caught between the islanders ' desire to protect their own and white political pressure to drop the investigation this film is full of sexy island women colorful reggae music and real world dilemmas of race and identity no matter that we could n't quite figure out if the plot hung together a winner,1
185,i was a teenager in the 80 's so i love all of the old 80 's teen movies but some kind of wonderful makes my top three the performances were believable the actors became the characters not the other way around eric stoltz is a level headed mechanic from the wrong side of the tracks literally who wants to pursue art instead of business mary stuart masterson is his best friend a tomboy drummer who is secretly in love with him lea thompson is the beautiful girl from their neighborhood who made it into the inner circle of popular rich kids on the basis of her beauty and her boyfriend craig scheffer is the rich bully boyfriend and the only off note keith eric stoltz is interested in amanda lea thompson and takes the opportunity to ask her out when she breaks up with her boyfriend to spite the boyfriend she says yes watts mary stuart masterson predicts trouble and their friendship is tested my favorite line from the movie is when keith defends amanda claiming you ca n't judge a book by its cover '' watts cynically replies yeah but you can tell how much it 's gon na cost '' finally watts agrees to help keith prepare for the date including helping him practice kissing '' and it 's a doozy of a kiss throw in john ashton as keith 's father maddie corman as his meddlesome sister and elias koteas as the scary guy keith befriends in detention and you have a wonderful '' movie,1
186,this final season is just ridiculous and not in a good way when the wayans abandon a project then you know it is unfunny and over just look at the scary movie films kelly coffield left because the producers wanted to use alexandra wentworth more a huge mistake ! kelly was hilarious save your money and avoid this stinker season,0
187,i made the mistake of watching it after seeing how many stars 4 it received from other viewers the plot was butchered the characters twisted the story ruined a pure agony marilla is fat and ugly was n't it supposed to be rachel lynde 's character matthew is sly and conniving and very outspoken what happened to endearing shy matthew rachel lynde had been merged with barry dianna 's mother and hence rachel barry oh brother dianna is a petit blond and not a dimpled raven black haired damsel who gets married behind the scenes without her bosom friend who was sent to queens at 18 as a punishment anne and gilbert are secret lovers brutally separated by marilla who is crossed with gilbert 's father for stealing matthew 's sweetheart many years ago get the picture this movie has no merits as related to the book it might have some as a creation but i have n't found any i wasted nearly an hour and a half of my life and was bitterly disappointed irritated and nauseated the creators of this movie were definitely not kindred spirits ! do yourself a favor if you really like the anne books do n't watch this movie oh and i do wish peter jackson lord of the rings will fall in love with the books and make proper and accurate movies out of them do you hear me peter,0
188,let me start off by saying that i have higher degrees in art art history music and romance languages so i am an admitted art snob '' having said that i would recommend that you try the baby einstein baby van gogh world of colors '' and baby mozart '' videos instead of this brainy baby video i find this brainy baby video to be slow boring insipid condescending and visually uninteresting i can not wait to put in something else wait you say is n't this about the baby who is watching it well i first realized that it is truly boring and not just me '' by watching my 's reaction to it she is now 10 months old and still does not like it she consistently snubbed her nose at this video she did not watch it for more than a few seconds at a time and always turned away to find something more interesting to do she has never had this reaction to the einstein videos i mentioned i tried reintroducing this video every few weeks since she was 6 months old thinking maybe she would grow to understand it better but after 4 months of this approach she still is not interested however the einstein videos have captivated her from the beginning and still do here are the specifics that i think are the problem the visuals are weak and not enough my daughter is bored by watching the other babies play with toys the female is distracting and annoying rather than engaging and instructional as intended the flow is not as coherent as the einstein videos which are broken into little themes that make sense in each video there is no charm or sense of humor like the einstein videos no i do not have any connection whatsoever to the baby einstein folks i 'm just saying that the brainy baby videos seem less professional and are not as engaging if you 're going to spend the money and spend your time watching a video with your baby buy one that you and the baby will enjoy together,0
189,the movie is one of my favorites works on both a romantic level and a comic level but where 's the widescreen todays consumers are more educated thank god and they 've almost stopped asking the stupid question why watch widescreen you lose the top and bottom of the movie ! '' they finally get that you are seeing more of the movie with widescreen and not less so how can i be expected to buy this dvd it is for all intents and purposes incomplete '' who 's going to pay for all of something and be satisfied with only getting some of it buy this movie as soon as ws version becomes availible,0
190,the five people you meet in heaven '' is a powerful book with many mixed emotions this film was a constant mystery as i never knew what would happen next the story is all about the people who affected eddie the most in his life the people he meets in heaven are interesting and also somewhat shocking some people he knew and some he had never met this was a great idea mitch albom kept me wanting to read as i usually am not too interested in books this truly is the greatest book i 've ever read and therefore i would definitely recommend it to everyone,1
191,any collection that has the lost patrol has got to be worth the 40 bucks that movie and boris karloff alone is something to behold but this collection also contains sgt rutlidge which a movie way before its time mary queen of scots i was n't even aware was a john ford movie the informer another great and cheyene autumn i think this set has a little bit of something for everyone i just wish that we knew if this was the 66 minute watered down version of lost patrol or the original uncut version,1
192,i watched this movie all the way through only because i paid 22.00 plus shipping and felt i should give it every chance to redeem itself it is a stinker and if there were minus number ratings i would give it -10 ! ! rated r '' for what language adult content i have seen disney films more deserving of the r '' rating this movie was silly definitely not entertaining in any way and i threw it in the same bucket i put my dog 's crap in when i clean up the yard i am a chris isaak fan have all his cds and went to his concert on december 9. the fact that he would associate himself with this garbage has changed my view of him and unfortunately even his music i did not find the film offensive i enjoy hard core porn i feel this is a rip off poorly done in all aspects and highly do not recommend it to anyone ! ! !,0
193,cop john kimble arnold schwarzenegger gets more than he bargained for when he goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher to pursue murderous drug dealer cullen crisp richard tyson while at the same time protecting the man 's young son pitted against a classroom full of rowdy moppets whose monkeyshines try his patience and test his mettle kimble may have finally met his match in more ways than one,1
194,one of john hughes best films ferris bueler made me laugh harder than any other hughes film the though of one high schooler having an entire town behind his back makes you wish you were love this film,1
195,an extraordinary film the vanishing brings to the screen the story of a young man as he searches for his missing girlfriend in the american northwest the movie falls into the type of category kiefer sutherland jeff bridges nancy travis sandra bullock and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances which are outstanding to say the least ! all the actors without exceptions give it their 100 and it really shows the chemistry is amazing ! very well written and very well presented it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again ! the setting the plot jeff 's strong sense of love devotion and determination are admirable and commendable and an example for all to follow ! the dialogues and the music are all wonderful ! in short the vanishing is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection !,1
196,this was a wishy washy attempt at the truth the facts are there in parts and pieces but it was not really put together well some of the choices of material are questionable as being truly valuable to the topic this dvd had an agenda and is not unbiased and i think it failed at it 's overall agenda there is more than enough information and to put together something more worthy and accurate than this dvd has attempted to do if this is the best contrasting evidence to the bush administration that can be produced after all that has happened in the white house and beyond we are truly in trouble the truth is out there and i think this dvd tripped over them and kept walking without looking down and gathering all the facts together there were plenty of important facts and things said worth listening to on this dvd but this dvd is maybe worth a glance but not a long hard look,0
197,if you are a dale jr fan this dvd is for you ! ! i 'm a hardcore fan and i loved shows the other side of dale off the track him with his buddies and just hangin lets you into his life which it pretty neat considering not many other drivers have done the hidden footage you even get to see his cat bud which adorable ! ! ! he shows off his new home and the shop,1
198,i watched this movie and once it finished i decided i had to log on to amazon and buy it up this film is so well done from the characters the actors the dialogue and the stories a pure enjoyment to watch i hope everyuone sees it at least once,1
199,for months disney advertised this as a special edition dvd but at the last minute that second disc mysteriously disappeared why this is false advertising and if i had my way disney would have a big fat lawsuit on their hands it 's unfair to force people who really want a to pay very expensive import prices to get one from the uk and to those of us who do n't own a player they did this same crap to alice in wonderland but the other way around uk lost a disc that we have and paramount and fox have done this to us fans of titanic by dropping the editions in the us but not in the uk and giving fans in the us a edition i do n't understand why these movie companies ca n't be consistent with their international releases and simply make a single version available for all people all over the world unfortunately i have chosen not to buy this crappy excuse for a special edition '' dvd i do not appreciate being lied to i still love disney movies as well as the excellent dvd editions when disney actually releases the product they 've advertised for months and i will continue to buy the quality dvd releases but i do not enjoy false advertisement,0
