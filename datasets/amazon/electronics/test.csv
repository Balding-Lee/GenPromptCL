0,i have extensive experience with wireless system setup and operation my whole system is all linksys gear after four hours on this camera i give up when you update the firmware it erases everything you programmed into the camera so beware i could get the camera to work in wifi mode picture is decent not great the motion sensing function triggers quite well the frustration comes from an inability to get the email function to work kept getting an error message with the system parameters setup so it should have worked the faq section on linksys website is almost i did not bother to call because in my past experience that is of minimal help and very frustrating features sound great but could not get it to work right i will find another unit,0
1,i set up a small security program with my macintosh intially i needed a pc to place the settings in the camera however once i got it hooked up to my security system it works beautifully i would recommend you leave the lights on though because if you do n't you will be getting just a black fuzzy dark image back if you are using this camera for security this camera is a very simple easy to use camera without the fuss of zooming pan tilt etc if you need a simple camera you ca n't go wrong with the wireless or wired version,1
2,bought these pretty cheap from the good great sound quality all digital transmission so no hissing look good decent battery life the bad needs drivers most usb headsets granted not wireless do n't does n't work on the mac if you are not playing music they beep every 15 seconds or so then after a couple of minutes they turn themselves off this drove me crazy and was not configurable takes you seconds every time you turn them on and try to pair them not terribly comfortable after about a month of normal use the headset cracked in the middle and stopped working bad quality o material the logitech people said they will refund whatever i paid for after i send them a copy of the receipt and the broken product too bad i get to pay for shipping and i 'm not even sure they 'll refund the original shipping lesson learned,0
3,i got mine to work in about 30 min following s huffs directions below followed exactly there was only one thing not mentioned that i had to do to get it to work once you get into the settings on the range extender to enable wep and put in the key and passphrase i had to turn wep back on on my router before saving the settings on the range extender basically just put step 6 before you save settings in step 5 this is what worked for me at any rate i 've had it for about 4 months now and it has worked as advertised i gave it 4 stars because set up was still kind of a pain from s huff the tips that anthony taylor left helped me get it working but i still had some issues i 've added onto his tips from his review below wep on your router or ap the button for 30 seconds if everything goes well both lights on the expander will turn blue and unplug while still holding button plug back in after secs your internet explorer browser and type default ip of expander a window will pop up leave the user name blank and put admin as a password this is default password sure that the default gateway and subnet mask settings are identical with your router or ap change password on the expander if desired save settings all settings should be correct due to auto configuration wep on the expander once again remember use same settings that you will be putting in your router or ap in step 6 aka same passphrase save settings again 5.5 as soon as you enable wep on your expander you will loose your connection to it as it 's now setup for wep and your router is n't keep this in mind drove me nuts to your router or ap settings and enable wep 7 unplug your expander for 10 to 15 seconds and plug it back in bang you 're done enjoy,1
4,while a nice product packed with great features when it works the bottom line is that it does not support twain drivers meaning you can not scan through any application other than scansnap big minus second minus is jams jams jams i have barely used this machine but the double feeds are incredible the rollers are new and the machine is clean i even tried using high grade color laser copier paper but still double feeds big time ! upon occasion i get a good feed and i am so thankful for that if you are planning to do some serious office organizing with various types of paper sizes and paper weights skip this product and go for a adf flatbed scanner this baby will jam up your day and consume all of your time with fiddling reorganizing the misfeeds and clearing jams think deeply before buying this one also with an adf flatbed you can scan books and unusual documents thin paper very heavy paper that an adf and the scansnap wo n't process by simply lifting the lid of the adf and taking the scan directly on the glass with scansnap you are screwed,0
5,i recieved this unit 3 bussiness days after i ordered it fast shipping to bad when i recieved it it only worked for 2 minutes ! ! ! sending back tomorrow not sure if i want another one only comes with usb charger no wall charger,0
6,garmin ique i 'm very pleased with my little ique while it 's not perfect it 's pretty darn amazing i had actually purchased a lowrence iway 350 gps but then my husband discovered the ique on sale at costco for about more with the ique offering so many more features i returned the lowrence and purchased the ique with my husband and i both having the same machines we can beam information to each other or send them over bluetooth it has taken many hours of playing around with it to get to learn the device as it is n't very intuitive and the manuals especially for the pda are limited my husband has spent a lot of time learning to use the gps and he 's learning its idiosyncrasies as far as planning routes and getting it to avoid routing through construction areas it 's very sophisticated and the maps are great better detail than the lowrence we purchased a 2 gig memory card and downloaded the entire map database onto it and there were still 300 gigs to spare i had no trouble downloading the maps or the active sync software the basic gps functions are easy to use once you get the hang of it the voice directions are clear and concise and it quickly if you go off course you can plan your route in advance without having the gps activated this is a good idea since it can take up to 5 minutes for the unit to locate the satellites and you can be on your way if you 've viewed your route before starting out i used the gps on a trip stratford canada and it was wonderful having the canadian maps as well as the us maps available i even used it handheld while walking to my from the theater every once in awhile there is a glitch it said the theater was on the left which would have taken me into the avon river ! but it 's generally right on target and i find most of the problems are operator error such as turning too soon the route to home '' feature is very convenient granted the ique does n't always take you on the shortest route but it will get you where you 're going and if you 're directionally challenged '' like i am it becomes indispensible the car mounting bracket works fine it 's popped off occasionally in hot weather but generally stays put the bracket would be easy to move to another vehicle the gps would work in a if you needed to use it in a rental car i 've spent more time learning the pda portion which uses windows mobile 2003 edition the ique uses outlook as its interface so you 'll have to have it installed on your computer not having used outlook before i installed outlook on my laptop and spent some time getting familiar with it which was helpful the pda has so many functions that it 's hard to even describe what this little machine can do it will organize all of your calendar functions and contacts checks accesses the internet if you get a card recognizes handwriting has a voice recorder interfaces with other bluetooth units sends alarms has word and excel even has a couple of good games i got a separate sd card for music and downloaded a lot of songs and the sound through headphones is quite acceptable it has bass boost it uses windows media player so you can organize all of your playlists you can download any programs that are available for windows mobile 2003 including tv shows and videos i never thought i 'd find much use for a pda but i 'm using it every day no more little notes on scraps of paper or a separate pocket calendar address book or even an ipod everything is in one little machine and even though it is n't that intuitive once you 've learned the basic conventions they translate to most of the programs we 've called garmin tech support a few times and although they are only open during regular business hours we found american staff who are very knowledgeable about the product since a good gps will run at least this was a great bargain at around we 've purchased screen protectors and are hoping it wo n't wear out too quickly as i 've heard palm pilots tend to do i 'm really enjoying the ique,1
7,while spending hours trying to figure out how to set the alarm i sometimes wonder what hater of humanity actual designed this thing,0
8,these are great earbuds i have alswys used sony dj headphones in the past and these are the first pair of buds i have purchased i am impressed for the money the sound quality is very good full and well rounded with good bass and the treble is not too bright they are pretty comfortable in the ears but it does take a little getting used to the cord is rather thin and very flexible but seems to be sturdy enough for most use the included 'case ' is a little tough to figure out but could be good for keeping them clean in a purse or backpack definitely recommended,1
9,after 3 hours of banging my head against a wall i finally called tech support they finally figured out that this is not compatible with computers you can learn that on their support website but in the standard documentation that comes with it,0
10,got my order quickly and found out that these cases are much better than the ones sold here locally and they were cheaper ! !,1
11,the battery life for this phone after one short year is abysmal after charging it all night it dies after a few hours of nonuse the redial button simply has never worked it is not user friendly at all although i could live with this if the two issues above were resolved i contacted at t and requested that they send me a new model that works since this phone is obviously defective if they refuse then i wo n't ever buy an at t product again and neither will anyone i come into contact with it 's that simple update at t refused to do anything about the phone despite the obvious flaws as a result i will never buy another at t product again at t you are exhibiting the traits of a company that will go out of business,0
12,i plugged my nano into this charger for about 10 minutes and picked it up to check it out it almost burnt my hand my nano is now toast ! i hope it just toasted the battery and not the whole device,0
13,great cable that works as advertised why spend 80 on a name brand cable which performs no better or no worse connected a third gen mot 6412 dvr with hd to a sony great picture a name brand cable will not transmit your digital signal 6 ' any better than this cables unlimited brand will,1
14,this is the gamepad i 've owned my first pc was in 1993 the gamepad was the gravis gamepad i recently upraded and there is no port on the new system plus i need more buttons for need for speed most wanted etc i love this controller i 've had it for two days and have had nothing but excellent results i 've only used it in nfs games i have them all the wifi works flawlessly and i have a wifi network in my house installation is simple and takes maybe the rumble only works on games which have forced feedback software this is totally understandable the feedback in is very slight but that 's not the controllers fault it 's a matter of programming by ea games i like the weight of the controller it 's not feather light so with that motor and battery weight added it feels more like a premium device just like the 67 with tax i paid for it canadian dollars i did n't like how my gravis gamepad as so light so this is a step up the analog sticks are a great for racing as they are progressive like a steering wheel they are rubber gripped for action i am used to the so i have mine setup in nfs to use both as a directional control without having to press the mode button to switch because you do n't have time during a race to press a button before switching it works as well as my old gamepad but feels betetr and has extra buttons and the other features listed make it worth the money if you in the usa you 'll be getting a much better deal it lists for 60 cnd here but only 30 us in the states cons it 's not as comfortable to hold as i would like but its much better than my gravis gamepad and the buttons are easier to hit on the new one conclusion i 'm very satisfied overall and i knew i may have to get used to the way it feels when i hold this controller since changing from the old snes style gravis gamepad rating only because it could be easier to hold,1
15,i type medical reports for a living up to 10 hours a day and 7 days a week without the wrist rest my wrists would not be able to hold up the wrist rest is the perfect size it stays in place on the desk the gel continues to be supportive even after a year of working on it the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because of the back of the wrist rest that lays on the desk has a horrible smell i ca n't smell it while typing only when i pick it up for cleaning i wish there was the option for half stars i 'd give this stars,1
16,works good for me some time one can hear some interference but over all a pretty good product,1
17,this receiver is a replacement for an older more expensive defective sony that i had it was easy to install and performs comparably well with more expensive units i am satisfied with the product,1
18,several reviews mention the improvement when these cables to replace a composite audio video cable or an plug almost all of that improvement is due to the fact that these cable connection methods are completely different types in signal format and the tv uses different internal circuitry for each one virtually any cable connection will give a better image than a composite type cable and any component individual video connection will be better than cable brand has absolutely nothing to do with it there may be some difference between one brand of component cable and another but its almost always unnoticable,0
19,i had a terrible time getting a station to come in even close to fm quality there was always a bunch of static and the stereo buzzed between songs because i had to keep the volume too high the high band of frequencies seemed to work best but then it led to crackling speakers everytime i turned something electrical on in the car it also seemed to kill batteries at a surprising rate on a positive note i loved the fact that it would also function for my son 's dvd but in the end it had way too much static so i hunted for anothe,0
20,as a journalist i need to tote around a microcassette recorder with me wherever i went now with the zen 's feature i 'm able to use it to record my interviews and it 's easier to transcribe because of its clear crisp recording quality you can also play files so unlike ipod users there 's no need to convert them in order to view them many might find it a bit bulky compared to the new ipod but with its added features it 's a small flaw that 's easy to overlook,1
21,i really enjoyed my zen when it worked the first one i ordered i had to return becuase it would only play every other song and after it started acting up all the lights would start blinking and i would have to take out the battery to make it stop so i exchanged it for a new one and just like the other after only one week the lights started going crazy again it would freeze up and would only play 5 seconds of every song what i liked about it for the small amount of time i had it was the sound quality the choice in colors and the fact that it was so much cheaper than other models with the same amount of storage space i 'm not sure i would recommend it becuase of the fact that they both only worked for a few days now i have an iriver clix and have had no problems it has less storage but i do n't care it is easier to control and i have n't had problems with it,0
22,does not work at all dont throw away your money should read 0 star,0
23,the second disc in this package was faulty which i did not discover until i spent two hours recording a movie there was what appeared to be a half inch bare spot on the outer edge of the not what i expected from memorex which purports to be the best i have switched to maxell,0
24,i got bars on my wifi detector and hoped that this would help but it did n't get any better you 'll have to get some decent signal beforehand in order to get this antenna to make things better for you i suppose,0
25,i have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time i have tried backpacks shoulder bags duffel bags but none of them really worked all that well then i saw the lowepro street and field system with completely customizable pouches vests belts and accessories it works great you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used put frequently used items in easier to access places the variety alone of this system is worth the investment but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus you can get a case for any lens camera body or accessory you have i even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle one word of caution be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch because sometimes the lens will fit but then the lens with the lens hood will not i often carry lenses extension tubes teleconverters extra memory cards and batteries and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets which weights a ton but when they are evenly distributed on this lowepro system it is actually very manageable the only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body but if you can overlook that this is the way to go i have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses many of the cases also come with a built in cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed you can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or do n't need to take all of your equipment which is nice i really ca n't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution consider this you wo n't regret it,1
26,this bracket will not fit the etrex vista cx this is because the battery cover supplied with the bracket replaces the original battery cover to provide attachement lugs will not clear the microsd card socket this is very frustrating because the garmin website even shows this bracket part number in the etrex vista cx accessories list so if you have a cx do n't purchase this item,0
27,i would highly recommend this phone set easy to program and crystal clear reception a definite 5 star,1
28,review this product over the internet and it is just what i was looking for my daughter of twelve years of age pros is portable and rechargable cons the sound is not as good as the boose but with less volume it is quite acceptabl,1
29,great batteries for cameras they charge quickly and it 's handy to keep the extra 2 spare in the charger and with me all the time just in case '',1
30,i purchased the monster cable mp hts 1000 without reading the reviews which i do n't usually do for the simple reason of where i purchased my hdtv samsung they were trying to sell me but for a 150 which was too much i plugged in my equipment to the monster and at first there was no picture only sound i have directv and they have a connection which allows you to receive digital and analog signals through the same cable that connection needs to be placed after the monster in the connection loop after switching around the cables i had a picture again i ca n't really see an improvement in the picture quality hd is beautiful i bought the monster basically for the protection,1
31,the zen micro is brilliant i have dropped it a load of times and it still works fine i 've dropped it on the kitchen tiles twice i 've dropped it a few times in the yard and it still works perfect i had to buy new headphones for it which made the sound quality much better it is very easy to transfer files to it i always use windows media player to transfer files as it is easier to use than the creative software i use it everyday and the battery lasts a good while for me overall the zen micro is a very good product,1
32,i opened it i put it in my psp and that was it i had plenty of space on the memory stick and i personally did n't have to do any special formatting i just popped it in and that was it i did want to add buy this online because in my comparison shopping it was much more expensive in brick and morter stores i visited,1
33,this is a great storage device i use it to store documents to take with me when i travel and i keep it in my purse i love the lanyard that helps me to keep track of the drive worth every i paid for it !,1
34,i have read all 181 reviews and decided that half the reviewers did not get the model that i did or else they wrote their review too soon i bought mine in june 2006. it failed before the store warranty ran out one down the replacement lasted a month or two before it hung and would n't boot two down sandisk honored their 1 year warranty with a prompt free rma that one also failed three down they replaced it with both a and a the hung after about 2 weeks four down i have been using the for two weeks now and hope it lasts until the replacement arrives i have gotten quite good at the rma game and intend to keep playing it either until my warranty runs out or i get one of those that other people rave about i do n't think i 'll buy another sandisk unless it is free and has a lifetime warranty i suggest that everyone with a failed to exercise thier warranty rights sandisk needs to know the true reliability of their products,0
35,could n't get any sw stations but am and fm worked great and the hand crank charged up the cell phone after a lot of cranking,1
36,the dvd burner connected very easily through usb was immediately recognized by winxp the software installation was fine i was beginning to feel good however whenever i burned a dvd i tried 4 different brands some r some rw etc several files would contain errors and would be completely unreadable the burning process moreover does not detect this one needs to verify the data written to check and find these errors moreover the firmware update just does not work on my machine pardon machines completely standard dell machines all latest winxp and drivers good cpus and up lots of memory big i called customer service to try to solve the problem first of all the average waiting time to get to a technician was about 30 minutes the rudeness and the plain lies these guys give you are amazing to make a long story short i had to call 3 times first guy oh of course it does n't work you have easycd creator installed ! '' ok i buy it i go through the painful uninstallation process of roxio 's software no problems solved second guy oh of course it does not work it requires of free space ! it 's written on the box '' plain lie on the box it says you need for nerovision for burning videos but only for nero quarrel they are tough ! with the guy who could not care less about the fact i got him lying or that the product description is wrong ok patiently i freed up from hard drive try again exactly same problem the only thing they could offer in the end was a replacement i got perhaps relative lucky because the replacement will be a 720 not a 710 since 710 is not manufactured anymore wonder why notice i tried this on two different machines one laptop and one desktop with identical results other lie i noticed as somebody else here that the nero software provided writes only on sony drives so if nero is really the only software that should be installed because of conflicts with roxio et you will never be able to use your own cd drive to burn cds how ridicolous is that the technician said this is because i had both software s installed but that was another lie the incompetence of these guys is beyond belief if the new drive will not work i hopefully will get a refund through my credit card you know the technician even said that that is not possible credit cards companies do not do that lol,0
37,just plugged it in and i 'm ready to ship it back creates an annoying high pitched buzz,0
38,from looking at the website and talking to five tech support staff it appears that there are countless versions of this card each with different driver software the one i got came with a cd with the wrong drivers with tech support i finally found the 8 mb driver file i was supposed to download however they did not provide any instructions on how to install the new driver the normal automatic '' approach did not work and their instructions did not match the screens i was getting on windows xp sp 2. so i called back again and again and again despite being given a case file each time i was asked the same questions including what exactly is wrong and each time i was told to do the same thing install from the cd reboot remove the program reboot install from the new driver reboot remove the program talk to a senior tech support person install from cd reboot etc it would have been easier to send the card with the right files on the cd a clearly designed website would be second best and tech support that knows what they 're doing and speaks intelligble english would be a nice last resort i spent three hours calling technical support and speaking to five people and they could not tell me how to install the software for this card ! i am not alone in this experience see cnet 's web site user reviews of the another reviewer reports that this software damaged his operating system i believe he is right it appears to have damaged my screen font for windows message boxes i have been unable to repair it the is bad news i give them two stars cause they actually have tech support though in this case it was utterly worthless back it goes,0
39,i have been going nuts trying to find a decent set of headphones for my new ipod all i wanted was decent sound for a decent price but after trying various models of and standard phones and returning them all i figured i was going to have to shell out some big bucks after all but then i decided to pull the trigger on some cans made by a great old company from my youth that used to be the only choice for koss of course ! and they still have it these are n't the greatest phones i 've ever heard but for 20 and it seems you can now get them for half that ! they easily compare to some sets costing 3 times as much or more finally no awful peaks that threaten to end my career as an audio engineer cough sony they are fairly i think i would rather have the traditional band but you get used to these pretty quick these sound nice the bass does n't thump like a lot of people like but to my ears it 's smooth and most important you can listen for hours without ear fatigue without a doubt these are the best budget phones i 've ever owned ! my bottom anyone who does n't grab these for 10 bucks a pop is insane period,1
40,this was my second dlo transpod i had an older white one that i bought used i figured i would upgrade '' to this one since my ipod and my car 's interior are black overall the thing performed similarly to my previous one but with a few little changes for one the output of this unit is much lower than its older counterparts that normally does n't matter if you choose a good empty frequency but as you start traveling you notice interference much more than you would expect next i ca n't turn it up any where near the volume i used to be able to on the older one without getting hissing and static it seems that the decreased level on the output also increased the amount of electronic noise when using it last the most annoying part of this whole product is that it turns off the radio transmitter after a period of no use i have paused my ipod to take a phone call only to have very loud since the level is so low on it you have to make up for it with stereo volume static and sometimes radio stations coming through very embarrassing or when you stop your car and then come back as soon as the radio turns on you are met with the same very loud noise since my car does n't leave me many options for stereo replacement this is the best product for my specific situation though i may try and get that old one back from my friend maybe an upgrade '' to a newer one will settle the deal,1
41,do not buy this mouse ! this mouse has given me nothing but frustration 1. the front of the mouse where the buttons are located is extremely low causing a muscle strain in your hand if you use it for long periods of time 2. battery life is horrible like 2 weeks 3. when your mouse is idle for 8 minutes it goes into an automatic sleep mode the manual says to touch the metal lines on the side to revive '' it but when i do it simply freeze the cursor on the screen so i have to reboot my computer absolutely the worst ! !,0
42,the picture is crisp colors are bright and the size is just right pretty good viewing angle as well,1
43,the only thing you will need when you buy this package is some extra paper ! i love the fact that epson advertises realistic figures for this package some other printer makers do not do this !,1
44,a while ago i purchased the same item maybe a month and i received what i paid for 2 walkie talkies 2 rechargable batteries and a charging base for the walkies in this last purchase i thought i bought the same things i even paid the same amount of money but neither the batteries nor the charging came in the package thank you humberto gonzalez san jose costa ric,0
45,i needed new computer speakers after my cyber acoustics died after only 3 months so i was n't going to buy the same brand since it died so fast i use a mac i wanted some nice sounding speakers but could n't decide to go with either the sound sticks creatures or these well since i am saving up for a new laptop i wanted to save as much money as possible plus me and my dad had bought this brand over 7 years ago and they still work and sound great so i decided to give these a chance well first thing i did when i got them was turn the volume up to max and sub base up to max yes i underestimated these speakers when i turned a song in in itunes i nearley got blasted out of my chair ! i was supprised by the sound clarity was pretty good even at higher volume and sub was powerful shaking my whole desk ! moral one do not underestimate speakers my good brands even with low wattage i highley suggest these speakers for people who do n't have much to spend or do n't want to spend alot of money if you want better quality i would go with sound sticks or creatures but these look like they will serve me well,1
46,i got this less robust remote because i only wanted to use it on one system and i was able to set it up and program all the different buttons and it all fits nicely in my hand they have great customer support available on the weekends the best part is everything goes on and off with one button ! the drawbacks a couple of buttons you ca n't program or use for anything and my goofey tv has 3 component modes and this thing is set up for 2 so getting it to sink up right is tricky and it 's constantly getting out of sink,1
47,a lot cheaper than docking stations and 'does what it says on the tin ' quite stylish too as docking stations go,1
48,excellent sound system reminds you of being in a movie theatre great great system,1
49,i bought magellan roadmate 700 vehicle gps 2 months back and its not working as expected its very poor in locating the the place and sometimes do n't even work many times this sytem got hung and power off and on again is the solution to get it work again might this product is very good in market but i got the bad piece,0
50,a friend gave me this card for free when i travled to arizona i use this card in my dell from time to time this card ca n't be recoginize by the pda i have to pull it out and it in and reset my pda then oneday my gps software showed map data corrupted '' all the data in the card was wiped out and the card 's space reduced to around have no idea where the remaining space goes to do n't put important data on this one ! ! ! that 's my lesson,0
51,i got this mouse because i have developed carpel tunnel pain in my shoulder from years and years of mouse activity i 'm happy to say it is nearly gone the pain i ordered one for my office and will now get one for home it does take a bit of getting used to after years of movable mouse action but it can be done good luck,1
52,this is my second one of these i pinched off the cable on my first one with a storage console door and had to get another ! the display has two settings very dim and off the one i had before was quite bright so they must have changed something that said it works perfectly you should n't be looking at the display while driving anyway,0
53,we bought 3 of these and every one has dead pixels it 's not a ton but one monitor has three that are red in the center of the screen and other has a few that are bright green in the corner not a huge deal but there are some in all 3,1
54,i have always had uniden cordless telephone and have always liked them i had purchased this one to replace my uniden cordless telephone which would interfere with my wireless modem on my computer this one does n't i also like the feature of the intercom feature my daughter has one of the handsets downstairs in her room and if she is n't on the phone i can contact her to talk to her my daughter also likes the mute feature where she can put somebody on hold if she is on the phone to ask me a question so that person on the other end does n't hear her the phone has many other features but those are 2 usefule ones i like along with the caller id,1
55,it broke after two uses it has an auto shutoff if no detection after 30 seconds and i plugged it in to everything and it would shut off every 30 seconds i was so mad i threw it out the window what a waste of thirty bucks,0
56,i wanted a keyboard that i could use in low light with both my pc and mac and this one is reasonably those users who enjoy the backlight of a mac powerbook or macbook pro will be disappointed by the cheap approach saitek used to illuminate the keys though on the mac each key has its own embedded light under the key on the saitek light is splashed under the entire keyboard reducing the contrast and making it much harder to see the keys but it 's better than nothing and is helpful in low light it would have also been nice if they had an fn key but such is life,0
57,i bought this product less than a year ago 2 days ago i locked my laptop and tried to unlock it but i could n't it was somehow messed up and the combination did not work i had to cut it ! ! ! i do n't know how it got messed up but i 'm sure that it was not study enough to last long,0
58,it 's not often i find a product that 's as disappointing as this the interference problem is very serious and makes most conversations a pain moving around the house and outside of the house standing on your head holding the phone at a 45 angle are part of the daily ritual in trying to hold a legibible conversation but that 's not the bad part the bad part as at least one other reviewer has noted is that each of the phones constantly reports a low charge '' message or something similar this in spite of the fact that we make minimal use of the phones and leave them in the charger most of the time the only solution i 've found is to take the battery out of phone and put it back in then it will work for a day or two i suppose it could be just the batteries but if so then we were shipped batteries that were already on i read a few good reviews of this phone and of course there are a number right here but out experience has been the opposite the phones have been nothing other than a pain,0
59,this headset is everything that i hoped it would be and the seller rates 100,1
60,what a waste of money for 300 you should n't have to buy a protection plan for the year of a products life unfortunately the poor quality of ipods makes it a necessity but the protection plan is riddled with clauses that exclude any number of reasonable issues i 've bought apple for the last 15 years but never again will i send them my money,0
61,the sandisk cruzer ti is the most durable thumb drive on the market i had a cruzer ti before this one i dropped it stepped on it and was just not too careful with it through all that it never failed me i needed an upgrade and picked this one because the was not available it move data fast and the new stuff is very interesting i am not all that used to the stuff yet but i am sure i will start to use it to its fullest soon of mine buy the less expensive usb drives and break them the sandisk cruzer ti is the absolute best,1
62,i initially chose this router because of its low price sometimes you get what you pay for and that is exactly what happened to me as a wired router this works well enough it connects four computers to the internet just do n't do anything to intense with it and you should be fine i noticed that when i view video media the connection totally freezes but for basic internet and downloading it works i generally find however that no one buys a wireless '' router not to use wireless and that is where the problem is the receiver is so painfully finicky it does not keep connections the configuration of this router is about as easy as brain surgery the linksys support team tries to be helpful but i ca n't seem to make this router reliable it drops reception all the time many times my laptop wo n't even detect a signal the wireless performance of this router is abysmal i sincerely hope that if you have this router it is working flawlessly for you i ca n't get it to work well for me not matter what i do the difficulty that i am having with this equipment is so bad that i am going to replace it as soon as i can,0
63,after serveral months of use card error '' was shown on my canon digital rebel for my viking card which was half full with pictures fortunately i just lost a few of pictures i tried to format the file card error '' kept occuring on my rebel this viking card is now used for my data files probably viking cards are not designed for high mega pixel camera and taking many shots in a short period of time 3 my canon has no problems when used with the viking card so far probably i am going to buy a card from sandisk or simple tech,0
64,1. there was a consistent buzzing on the phone even when i tried multiple jacks for the base 2. phone features worked as advertised but the voice enhancer is useless and actually makes it sound worse 3. it was kind of a pain to sync the phone books which are separate on each handset i returned it mainly because of the buzzing,0
65,worked fine for a couple of weeks and then just died the problem was that it was not recognized by xp or linux anymore,0
66,pros xlnt quality long cord usb or connection xlnt accuracy very comfortable feel easy access to side buttons great gaming mouse affordable cons none this is by far the best mouse i 've ever owned bar none,1
67,these radios look nice but there are some problems here first the batteries do not last long unless you do not talk second the biggest problem for me was uncompatibility with other radios and brands the receive quality is very poor and hard to understand at times i also hace a and the difference is like night and day the 7200 is the best the 7400 i believe is an has flaws and that is why you see them priced so low i paid 24.00 on ebay and also have seen the set at home depot clearance for 44.00 today what good is any radio if you cant understand what someone is saying good try motorola but this is a poor recommended to purchase,0
68,i 've been using these memorex for years and have no problems with their reliability have used them with multiple cd and dvd burners without compatibility issues this was another and i continue to be happy with this product,1
69,the microtrack will not hold a charge by itself or even operate very long when hooked up to an external usb battery pack it just drains away under charge the concept for this a pretty good but the implementation woefully lacking almost to the point where i may not reliably recommend to others,0
70,this was my first set of headphones and i bought them because they are cheap well you get what you pay for being disappointed with the fit of the koss phones i bought the slightly more expensive jvc at least for me a much better fit which means more comfort and better sound and i am still shopping the array of offerings is daunting jvc and jplug at about 20 all the way up to shure 's top of the line at 500 so shop around but forget about the koss,0
71,i have searched and searched and searched for a pair of portable headphones that sound as good as these with lots of failure imo you can not beat the sound of a set of '' headphones i have tried all styles earbuds behind the neck clips even the ear plugs nothing gives the sound and comfort of the ktx pros granted i have never tried the sportapros or portapros but from what i have read they are the same headphone except they are ugly ! the ktx pros have both great lows and great highs plus you ca n't beat that price,1
72,bought a cell phone battery that of course died one week past their deadline refused to refund or replace even though the product is clearly defective this company is a ripoff and will never do business with them again consider yourself warned,0
73,i mistakenly believed the hype that this thing would protect my computer from being killed but instead this thing has killed my computer for the second time in 4 days emitting an ca n't turn the feature off shriek alarm how do smart talented people idiotically convince themselves that a home product should have an that ca n't be defeated silenced in addition to doing far far more damage than it can ever prevent ask yourself do you want this shriek alarm going off in your house at i bought one apc product and so far they 're 100 defective and 100 deliterious to the use of my computer it 's a matter of time before it 's deliterious to my sleep,0
74,although there are more expensive options if you 're just looking for something to keep your ipod from sliding all over in the car the isqueez is a great option i use this with the monster icarplay fm which uses the dock connector i ca n't get my ipod mini to fit all the way down in where it should because of this but it still fits in there well enough to stay in place i find that it holds the ipod at a great angle for viewing the screen from where you 're sitting though i 'd recommend putting the passenger in charge of finding music,1
75,wow who would 've thought that you could get such amazing products at affordable prices the staff 's friendly and responds quickly to any questions that you may have this is one amazing phone system uniden i forgot that it 's a cordless,1
76,i bought this router and spent almost two hours online with linksys after trying every sort of suggestion and speaking with three different tech support people who barely spoke english i finally understood that linksys has limited support for macs '' when i asked what limited support '' means i was told we are not trained to help people with a mac if you can borrow a windows pc we can help you '' what a waste of time i am sending the router back beware if you have a mac,0
77,as you may already know this is an accessory handset which will only work if you have one of these panasonic models the panasonic does not need or use a telephone jack it simply plugs into any standard electrical socket and works off the base unit with one of the models mentioned above this phone was also very easy to register it had to be charged for about 2 hours before it could be registered i simply had to press the mute '' button on my base unit and then press the play '' button on the phone the registration directions were even displayed on the lcd display on the phone ! please know that i did find the panasonic instaltion directions to be a little confusing some features that are not mentioned in this description which are included are finger sizing on the sides of the phone the opportunity to play your answering machine messages off this phone the base unit to the has a digital answering machine and i suspect the other panasonic models do as well this was the main reason why i purchased this phone yes the will play your answering machine messages off this phone through the speaker on the back of it ! ! ! a separate call waiting '' dedicated button is also included also this phone will use any standard headset it does not need a panasonic branded headset this was very important for me because i ofen use a headset and i do not want to purchase another one i have since learned that all cordless phone headsets can be used on any type of cordless phone ! please know that the batteries on this phone are not interchangeable with the system that is the model that i have also the phone ca n't be charged in this charger and vice versa that is likely because the phone is slightly smaller and weighs less the face of the phone is white with a purple trim the back of the phone is also purple on the bottom and white on the top half the white '' in the phone is sort of a shiny metalic white and the purple '' is not shiny at all some of the buttons are also slightly smaller than the buttons on the model and the lcd screen is not flat it is indented slightly and bordered in silver i purchased this phone from an merchant and am very pleased with it i noticed that another merchant is selling the same phone that i purchased for less 30 however that merchant has horrific feedback and i was only too glad to pay a little extra for the confidence of knowing that i would receive a phone in a timely manner that would work ! panasonic makes very good phones the only big problem is the battery life the batteries often die after less than 90 minutes i have solved this problem by purchasing a second set of batteries however this is still not a perfect solution so i had to purchase another set of cordless phones uniden i now keep two phones in each of the rooms that i had each of the panasonic phones and so far have not run in to any problems i hope panasonic will offer batteries with longer lives soon all in all this is an excellent phone i hope the extra details that i provided will help a prospective buyer make the right decision rarely provides specific details to these types of questions does only employ braindead dimwits and the panasonic website does not offer this info,1
78,it has very good definition but is slow even in the night is not that good and is slower,1
79,when it works it works very well but one day it suddenly died on me i had a comcast technician come and test my modem and after using some complicated equipments to test it he concluded that the modem is dead after he gave me another modem my network is up again very bad reliability motorola should be more responsible for their quality control !,0
80,i use these batteries when i need power immediately and i do n't have a set of rechargeables ready to go i also use them as backups so i do n't get caught without power and have to pay 1 a battery at supermarkets and convenience stores unfortunately my kids keep stealing them instead of recharging their own set,1
81,i 've owned this headphone for about a year now and i 've got to say after going through multiple headphones this beats all others i 've tried if this one ever broke i doubt that 'll happen anytime soon i 'll surely buy another one again ! pros comfortable to wear the ear cushions are indeed comfortable to wear for extended periods of time even if you wear glasses you wo n't feel uncomfortable clear treble middle and bass you can hear all the subtle sounds in your song clearly even with completely flat eq setting the headset does very good job with sound provided you increase the volume up a bit more as with any headphones take time to 'break it in ' to have it function the best it can it means to leave music playing on the headphone for very extended period of time about 24 or 32 hours sturdy wires this headphone seems to have been designed based on recording headphones in this regard the wire is very thick and long also it 's single wire format cons ear padding is perhaps too soft this means it wo n't fully cover your ear area and some of sound may leak out so note that when you listen to your music loud in public places although at first few weeks the ear padding is relatively hard if you are looking for a headphone that will ensure your music will never leak out look into getting canal type headphones instead as some others have pointed out tilting your head too forward or backward will make your headphone just drop from where it is at so be cautious of your movements you might not want to wear this kind of headphone during summer due to poor ventilation but this affects all closed headphones so it 's not a huge negative point the headphone is quite big and on a small head you may have a difficult time keeping it up on your head the size of the headphone is designed for a fully grown average adult head that 's all i 've got to say and overall this headset is definitely worth your money,1
82,after purchasing my canon this summer and using the four pack of tdk tapes abc warehouse gave me with the camcorder i went online and found these tapes and bought two ten packs due to the great price and the jvc name they have only done one thing clogged up my video head on the camcorder i videotape my sons basketball games for their coaches and it was only after the first couple of games and bad recordings that i got onto canon 's website and realized my video head was clogged i purchased a head cleaner and the first tape after the cleaning taped great but the next tape clogged my head up so to use these tapes i highly recommend you clean your video head after each use which is not good for your video head on your camcorder,0
83,a short review do n't buy this product the wire is too long and the remote control is too heavy for the jack to hold after a month of the remote and wire hanging and swinging about the wire where it 's connected at the jack gave out making this remote unuseable i have to jiggle and find the sweet spot now just to make the remote work long wires plus a remote adds considerable stress and weight on the jack a serious design flaw if you want to buy this i suggest you tie the wire and the remote using a rubber band around your ipod to support it 's weight without pulling the wire off the connector,0
84,great combo but does not play dvd 's from other region does not have an eject button on the remote either if u have dvd 's vcd from other countries that you would be playing i do not recommed this player,0
85,although this policy is thru apple it is the price of similar policies available from other companies that also have very good reputations one is which has a 2 plan for 29.99 which starts the standard apple 1 yr labor coverage for a total of 3 years apple extended warranty is a total of 2 years for 59.99 rather than a total of 3 years for 29.99 thru crutchfield,0
86,i purchased this router not from amazon about 6 months ago when my very reliable router died i purchased it locally and someone came out and installed it i have had numerous problems with this router since then it does not stay connected and there is actually no option for always on '' after having some other problems i took it back and the vendor upgraded the firmware after that it lost the setup information twice and the info had to be then today after being instructed to reset the router it got stuck in a mode where it only wanted a firmware upgrade there was no apparent way out of this so i obtained the upgrade and according to the router message it was updated successfully after that i could not get the router to work at all i gave up and ordered an entirely different router the same brand that i has used before with tremendous success my summary save yourself time and aggravation and do n't buy the linksys,0
87,the is another great logitech product it is far from the king of the mouse but when it comes to the notebook it does n't get much better than this it takes two aa batteries so get some rechargeable batteries to save on costs which slide into the top of the mouse by pulling back on the palm rest to reveal two slots the mouse does n't weigh too much heavier than the two mouse batteries themselves this is a two button mouse with a tilt wheel with the setpoint software you can alter what the buttons do overall the design is good there could be a problem installing setpoint it may hang on install if so you need to use the task manager to quit the install and then try it again it should work the usb receiver is 2.4 ghz and has a 10 meter range wow however there is one major problem with a wireless mouse for a notebook usb dongles and receivers that are plugged into the side of the laptop are just begging to be snapped off for this reason you should have the usb receiver on the side opposite the mouse hand if you can to avoid accidental contact it should also not be hanging over the edge of the table if you press it down lightly then that is it game over for the receiver and you will have to get a new 2.4 ghz receiver so okay you will have to spend on a new receiver if you break the old one the receiver plugs into a small slot under the mouse using a magnet when it is in the holder the mouse turns off it does n't fit in smoothly it creates a block shape in the bottom of the mouse anyway you are not going to be using it when it is clipped in the other thing is that it can pop out sometimes just happens if the mouse just gets knocked a certain way i am sure most notebook users are cautious with their notebooks and devices if you are then a mouse like this and usb should last for a very long time there is really nothing wrong with it wireless mini mouse fab ! however there is one last thing to say if you do n't like the idea of a usb receiver then get a bluetooth version of this mouse instead it is called the that is if your notebook has internal bluetooth or else you will need to get a bluetooth usb receiver and be in the same boat when it comes to watching your usb receivers but if you have a bluetooth internal receiver with your notebook then by all means head over to the and forget about this usb option the usb design is n't a fault with the mouse it is just a fault with all notebooks that is not really a fault you just got to switch to internal bluetooth or learn to take care of your receivers,1
88,i was debating over the picturemate kodak printer dock 3 sony and the hp photosmart 475. i made the choice of the hp and i love it ! the prints are and look like real lab prints i use the hp boarderless premium plus photo paper with the hp ink and the prints are just wonderful forget the other bad reviews because this printer beats them all the hp produces bright vivid pictures designed to last a lifetime the picturemate is also alot larger than the hp 475. the hard drive is a plus as well hp said that the remote is not included but they lied they come with the remote and battery overall this printer is the best i have own,1
89,i was in the market to upgrade my printer and used amazon 's reviews to decide on a canon it does a good job but when i plug the usb cord into the printer the connection to the internet drops every time i have to disconnect from the printer so i can get recently i filled out a rather lengthy application on the internet and plugged in the usb cable so i could print that step caused the connection to drop and i got to reenter all the information i will be returning the canon and start my search for another one printer,0
90,i am sorry to say that my experience with the cd player has been miserable after a series of unhelpful conversations with sony folks i am going to return it it often fails to read the cd or cuts in and out on new cds that play perfectly in other cd players the shuffle program simply spins and spins and rarely settles down to actually play a cd it occasionally generates a read error message uh yeah even if on continuous '' play it often fails to recognize the cds loaded into it instead it displays a no disc '' message then even if it does play a series of cds on continuous play at some pt it just stops it has been like this since i first brought it home and has not improved in the weeks since the experience with the tech support people alone convinced me that they do not care it took a long time to even get through their tech support lines the first night i had it and then a lot of persuading to even get them to agree that their cd player was not working then they tried to convince to me send the brand new machine back a to have them repair it uh no not likely to fall for that paying them to repair a brand new machine straight out of the box taking time out of my life to ship it to them i finally have a reference number with permission to return it to the store for a full refund so back it goes then there are the limitations on the remote control that others here have noted since i had the same shuffle problems with my previous sony carousel player i am not inclined to try a machine needless to say no more sonys are coming into my life,0
91,i purchased this in the hope that i would be able to record verbal messages to myself creative thoughts and ideas etc it does an adequate job of that i had also hoped i could use it as a simple player to download affirmations and such to listen to throughout the day this it wo n't do and it was not clear to me from the information here and on the olympus site that it would not function this way first even though it records wav files it does not let you handle them well at all to transfer recordings to your computer you have to install special software included but you can not transfer wav files back to the recorder according to the software guide if you want a to function easily like that you should go for the more expensive ones that allow you to use them as a usb flash drive like the creative zen series i did not install the software as it offered nothing other than the simple transfer of a recording to my computer i can record directly to the pc with much higher quality so why bother noise recorded in a high quality format is still noise it makes more sense to simply repeat anything i record on the olympus and record it directly to the pc second the sound quality is not great given that wav files are what are used on cds one would expect more than what this device delivers it is noisy on either of the mic settings and i would have to describe the sound quality as medium do n't expect high fidelity this is a voice recorder for recording quick notes and not much else even analog tape would be better for most things i may be fussier than most about this having some professional background in audio so the sound quality may be okay for most people people have gotten used to lower standards in just about everything finally playback was very disappointing to me it has only the simplest playback features it plays pauses fast forwards and reverses period you can not repeat either a single recording or portion of one and you can not create any kind of list to specify only certain files to play it plays manually one recording at a time and that is it you can not set markers to fast forward or reverse to like chapters on a dvd and searching through a recording of any length is a major pain in fact this recorder is defined more by what it can not do than what it can do it is well built physically although it is definitely designed for small hands and can be a bit uncomfortable to use if your hands are n't small if all you want is to record medium quality voice this will work fine do n't expect it to record music or anything like that you will be disappointed think of it as the audio version of a 20 digital camera cheap quick grabs the image but no frills at all do n't expect much and you wo n't be disappointed i am usually very happy with olympus gear but this is definitely below their usual standard unless your needs are very spartan and smple i would recommend looking at more capable devices,0
92,echoing most other reviews here this is an excellent set of earphones that are well worth the money but buying them is a risk ! if you do n't wear these earphones correctly they sound terrible easily shown up by any pair of throwaway phones those unsatisfied with the sound quality especially those complaining of lack of bass either have n't put them in correctly or have oddly shaped ears learning how to put them in properly takes time be prepared to spend a few hours fiddling with them and trying the different included cushions once you teach yourself how to put them in it will only take a few seconds some tips before inserting the earbuds draw the phones up from behind your ear holding the earbuds in the correct orientation drivers pointing medially so the wires fall naturally between your head and pinna and the earbuds are just outside your ear canals with one hand pull the superoposterior part of the pinna in a superoposterior direction while inserting the earphone with the other this straightens the ear canal and makes it easier to insert the earphone your doctor uses the same maneuver when examines you with an otoscope you may also wish to twist the earphone during insertion so that it lodges itself better if the phones are properly inserted they will have sealed your ear canals and you may want to relieve pressure via your eustachian tubes that is swallow just as on a climbing plane or skyscraper elevator it may seem like it takes a lot of work and possibly learning a bit about anatomy to get these earphones to work as intended it does and success is not guaranteed but it 's worth it ! and to save your hearing do n't forget to turn down the volume since your music will no longer have to compete with outside noise,1
93,these are some great headphones with a few minor flaws pros 1. great sound quality 2. very comfortable 3. light 4. charging cons 1. achieving good wireless connection is not always easy could require pressing the button several times 2. interference noises could sneak into the broadcast 3. turning them off could be annoying requires precise timing my experience i 've had two pairs of these for over a year and i like them very much i enjoy great sound watching tv or listening to music while everybody is asleep this is really great i can enjoy music at comfortable levels at any time of the day or night the sound is much better and clearer than the sound produced by the speakers of the tv you have the same clarity and volume even though you might be moving around the rooms away from the tv closet or the garage for example the headphones are light and very comfortable i tried other brands and the were the most comfortable by far so overall wonderful product however there a few flaws to be aware of consider the following before buying it might require several attempts before the unit tunes in at the right channel sometimes turning the headphones on results in poor reception if any at all to correct this you have to press the only button power search and turn off and wait until the unit picks the signal at the right channel you might have to repeat this operation two or three times and it is a bit annoying once you get good reception everything is ok although you might get some interference alien noises when you turn your head or move around the last problem is with the turn off button again the only multifunction button you need to press and hold the button for a certain amount of seconds and release it in order to turn off the unit that is not always easy and usually the unit comes back on you think you turned it off but it is still on and if it 's not in the charger base you drain the batteries completely well i hope my description is helpful regardless of the flaws i recommend the i use them every day and best of all i enjoy great sound when other people are asleep,1
94,this radio is poorly built when you set it down the little door in back opens and the batteries fall out you put them back in carefully set it down then when you pick it back up the little battery door falls open and the batteries fall out again now i put rubber bands around the whole radio to keep the battery door in place away from this particular model unless you have lots of rubber bands good luck and thanks for the opportunity to write the review bruce payn,0
95,do not buy this item it is very liable to break within the first week of purchase and i bought 2 of them so statistically it 's not jsut me the first time the door broke and without the door there 's no way to hold the ethernet cable to the connection the second time the usb part broke off and got stuck in my computer and i could not put it back together all in all not the best product out there try instead the belkin usb to ethernet adaptor,0
96,i 've used the itrip by belkin the tunecastii by belkin and this monster icarplay for getting my tunes to my car speakers this is the best design and works the best of the three i like that it can charge my ipod and that the transmitter itself is inline the signal seems to be decent enough though of course it crackles sometimes or you hear a bit of static this gets more pronounced the louder you make it i think this is the safest for car use the itrip is a nightmare because you have to change the station through the ipod so if you 're taking a car trip i live in ny but went to college in mi that 's a 12 hour drive and signals are coming in and out and you need to adjust you really ca n't do it safely with the itrip the tunecast is a bit better but that runs on batteries the optional supply that i got for it did n't work also you can tune into any fm station with the buttons which is good but you really only need the lower stations the icarplay has 8 frequencies it can transmit over and only 1 button though i feel limited by the 8 i do n't think going higher would help because there 's more congestion i like the single button because there 's no confusion whether you 're going up or down and you can press the button then easily tune the radio up a notch the other limitation i see is its ipod specific uses dock connector whereas the tunecast just hooks into the headphone jack and it only works in cigarette lighters so you ca n't use it without a car or something else with that power source but considering i bought it to use in my car it does what it should and does a decent job of it,1
97,summary idea very poor implementation good software and easy to use major problem is reception of radio stations i live in a major metropolitan area and have to practically stand on my head to get the radio shark to get clear reception even with a plug in antennae,0
98,just got this camera in the mail as a birthday present installing the software was easy but unfortunately the camera is essentially broken it is only somewhat for items about 1 inch away adjusting the focus ring does n't help so this camera 's build seems to be defective my brother bought the same camera and it does n't seem to have the same problem anyway returning mine,0
99,i posted a review two weeks ago but it has n't appeared so i 'm trying again i bought this lock two years ago it has always been difficult to remove note despite what some other reviewers seem to think it does not have a motion detector that 's a different lock recently the lock decided to remain firmly inside my ibook despite my efforts to remove it after a fruitless call to targus 's customer support i finally got it out that took over 30 minutes of struggle my next step was going to be purchasing a hack saw apparently the targus lock is not a good fit for ibooks i 'm going to send mine back and demand compensation if you own an ibook i strongly suggest you buy a lock made by someone other than targus,0
100,this does what it 's advertized too i like not having wires the ipod in my bag and just the headset it would be a bit better if you could control the power on the ipod from the headset ie turn off the headset receiver and ipod all from the headset instead i have to get the ipod back out turn it off turn the receiver off then turn the headset off otherwise the sound is good and the headset has n't broken for me yet,1
101,this is wonderful for laptop users that travel or like to move your laptop around a lot if i leave my laptop somewhere i hate having to worry about tripping over wires and wires everywhere just look bad this is really small and compact ! perfect for traveling too i 've used it for about 8 months now and it hasnt had one problem it still recoils well,1
102,it works with all my devices it has several outputs for your different devices no complain with it,1
103,i purchased the kensington after my casette adapter developed an annoying wheel noise i heard and read a lot about the problems with fm transmitters like static and audio quality but the kensington was the best rated unit it arrived the day before i had to take a business trip and thought it would be a great test the first day i used it it seemed to work great the next day on my return trip home all i got was static and could barely hear the music from my ipod i tried every station i could find with little or no transmission on it but the audio quality remained extremely poor i am not sure if there are just too many stations broadcasting in the nyc metro area or this particular unit is defective but since my car has a casette player i will go with casette adapter for now if you have lots of unused frequencies it might work in your area just be sure you can return it if it does n't work out for you,0
104,i am satisfied works great with my phone nokia,1
105,these are very comfortable to wear and the sound is great i use them out jogging and they stay put without any pressure on the ear the tight fit blocks out any outside noise so be careful around traffic as you can not hear cars i would highly recommend these to anyone,1
106,i did n't buy this on amazon but wanted to say this device is great the only bad thing was my laptop is old ! ca n't go wrong with this one,1
107,good price good company i use this on my kodak and it 's fine good product to buy,1
108,i bought this backpack for walking to work each day with my laptop and various other items i need to carry back and forth umbrella lunch spare battery paper etc it 's well designed and constructed and has fulfilled all my expectations its size allows me to carry a hefty foldup umbrella which can lie horizontally i was concerned it size might make it intrusive or awkward but it 's not my only minor complaint is that the buckles on the shoulder straps slip gradually and need to be tightened every couple of days,1
109,i received it today and it 's a monster if you 've seen one in a store it looks twice as big on your desk until a few hours ago i was running two 20 '' aluminum cinema displays on a pny after doing online research about using the 30 '' display under windows xp i found that the functional '' cheap solution being used is in fact the pny verto with two dvi connectors considering that the other two most noted solutions quadrofx 4000 agp or parhelia pci are going for on ebay i was willing to give my old beater a try besides i did n't feel like buying another agp card with pcie taking over the world or sacrificing the only pci slot in my shuttle xpc to my great relief the monitor worked on the card right away even showing me the post and windows screen it did for the 20 '' displays too but to my absolute delight the card is actually running both the 30 '' and a 20 '' in color the 20 '' looks absurdly small next to the 30 '' like i did n't water it enough or something the 30 '' is enormous enough that i think it might be better were it curved ! maybe i 'm just sitting too close the only problem with the is that the dvi jacks are so near each other that i had to take the plastic housing off of the 20 '' plug to fit it below the 30 '' i 'm not a gamer so i ca n't say whether the card performs well for that it feels as zippy as with the 20 '' on regular windowing tasks i use eclipse flash photoshop but no video editing or stuff the screen had a slight warm cast that i did n't like nvidia 's control panel let me adjust it manually and now my 30 '' and 20 '' look almost identical my biggest fear was of course dead pixels by the good grace of lucky ducks this is the third panel i 've gotten from apple with no dead pixels brightness is uniform but for a very very subtle drop in the far lower left and right edges it 's not apparent unless you put white there and actively look for it in any case i bought it to get more programming panels on the screen at once and it does a fine job at that i 'm using the 20 '' for browsing and alas a few panels that still do n't fit apple where 's 3840 x 2400 i strip one star cuz it 's crazy expensive,1
110,the navigation kit works well although you do need a mostly flat area to set it on our toyota highlander lacks enough room between the windsheild and the dash to set it up on top but we placed it below the gear shift on the center console and it worked quite well the ique was able to hold signels with no problem i think the suction base might be a better solution for cars with out a low flat dash area,1
111,this adapter will not work at all with windows xp despite any promises from the linksys website this can not be setup buy the anycom adapter instead,0
112,why would you want this item amazon is charging 50 more on this item than the generation shuffle ! and according to what i have read this shuffle is n't very derable it does n't even last a year ! i do n't know about you but i 'll get a generation shuffle,0
113,do not waste your money this was under recommendations but i would not recommend this with your creative zen my daughter purchased this after saving up for an player this just does not seem to give enough power we plug it in and 12 hours later it is still charging plug the into the computer usb and it is done in less than 2 hours it may work fine for some other things but not the creative zen it would cost more to return and they will only exchange it so guess we are just eating the cost and s i should have read the reviews before would have seen that you get what you pay for do n't waste your money,0
114,good sound quality for the 150 per pair price tag easy to install,1
115,i purchased this item for a long trip so i could charge play my zen player in the car without worrying about battery life on the trip it worked great i am also planning to use it for my notebook in the car the same way because the car adapter for my notebook costs 100,1
116,it did n't work properly from the time it came out of the box the carousel would n't make a complete rotation so cds and dvds would get 'trapped ' inside the unit and occasionally it would simply refuse to play a dvd altogether panasonic has directed us to a local repair shop so maybe they can get it to function as it should if you do purchase one please read the warranty carefully a defective unit will either have to be repaired or replaced with a refurbished one panasonic informed me that they do not replace malfunctioning units with new ones under any circumstances,0
117,i was looking for a very basic palm that would become my calendar and contact list and this is perfect for both ! ! it 's very easy to learn and enter stuff i 'm a first time pda owner and this is an excellent product !,1
118,there is n't too much to write about this except is delivers as stated great product for the price,1
119,i received the ipod quickly which was a plus but it was horrible when it would only download 5 songs i had friends who have the same ipod try to fix it and it never worked i sent it back and requested a refund it has been a month and a half and i have yet to get my 120 back,0
120,i had several problems with the ipod mostly because of its horrible software itunes it messed up the firmware on the device several times it would complain constantly that it is not up to date and then try to update it which resuted in several crashes the most horrible thing however was that it would mess up your music collection in a way that can never be undone i had orgaized my collection in the file system nicely by genre author album etc and this thing messed up everything i have another player iriver which i reccommend as a lot better than the ipod anyway and i wanted to be able to copy things on it from my library now i am not able to and have to go back and the mess manually ! i do not recommend the ipod and i do not recommend using their software either,0
121,got it at walmart ca n't even remove a scuff i give it -100 good thing i could return it,0
122,the product not only did not work but blew out fuses in my car the mechanic who checked my car out said the device had a dead short in it i have written to your customer service department and asked for money back but to no avail i will not purchase another thing from amazon until my money is refunded,0
123,the camers is good in picture quality and easy to install and use it 's multi utility for desktop and notepad is a very good feature which i personally expected i have a complete satisfaction,1
124,those people giving these speakers low reviews because they do n't have enough bass are idiots i do n't know what people expect of these little speakers but it is difficult to imagine them delivering as much bass as they do these are amazing little speakers that have accompanied me in all of my travels from paris to camping in northern california i can not imagine going everywhere without them they are not equivalent to a stereo system but they are not meant to be all i need is my zen touch or zen micro and these speakers do not listen to the other reviews these speakers will make a decent stereo of your player enjoy them anywhere,1
125,this is n't the type of behavior i would expect from such a valuable and big company as amazon is they cancelled my order same way as the other people 's they did n't even send any notification email and i found my order cancelled by looking at the site amazon must learn that this is illegal and they must ship all the orders placed if they made a mistake pricing the item is their problem not ours and more after many customers confirmed the price over telephone if amazon do n't ship the orders already placed they will throw stones over their own roof and make lots of bad publicity i 'm one of many who wo n't be buying anything ever if amazon do n't send me my ordered items count with me for any legal actions that may be taken,0
126,i decided to purchase this item because i needed to get sd memory for my digital camera so i chose this one because of the price and the brand sandisk is known for their memory well no need to say more this thing works great i will buy another one but with more space anyday thanks alot san disk,1
127,this map set met all my expectations and was far more current than i had expected software for turn by turn directions on roadways while driving works great with the garmin ctrex gps recommended to load many states you will need large memory card 1 gb,1
128,this webcam is not compatible with acer ferrari with windows xp i do n't know why i just returned it,0
129,bottom line up front works very well very low price works much better with the included drivers than with the generic windows xp driver detailed review i bought this so i could use my new treo with my laptop the price was my main motivation in buying it initially i just plugged it in and used the default windows xp drivers and it worked okay however it did n't always work and i 'd have to for my phone and the device to find and talk to each other after getting tired of that i decided to install the drivers that ship with the product i 've had a much better experience since i did that i was afraid the software would be really clunky given the cheap price but it 's actually quite good and gives you a ton of options that the standard xp driver does not provide if you use a this with a laptop and you it you 'll have much better luck if you stop the adapter prior to otherwise you 'll probably end up having to it,1
130,i had high expectations for this product having bought some of sandisk 's other products the problem with the is that sandisk does n't give users the control or the versatility over file management for example using it in the mass storage msc usb mode one is forced to create playlists in windows media player this works but one of the drawbacks is that playlist creations can be plagued with files that have errors or are skipped it would be far better if one could just drag folders and music files to the right folder and play them with multiple folder levels this would allow catogorizing music the way the user wishes instead sandisk adopts an almost microsoft mentality in its approach it 's our way or the highway '' once one masters creating playlists they have to settle for dumping them all into one directory it 's too bad because reading the manual and reading the reviews one can easily get the idea that the series can be set up like just another usb storage device including other previous sandisk products well you can but it wo n't make much difference if the device wo n't play,0
131,i ca n't get good reception at any range from source intermittent when two rooms away from source have to move the speaker unit around to find an acceptable location does n't automatically retune when being turned back on not at all what i expected from this piece of equipment,0
132,these 2.0 speakers sound great and not just for their size are adjustable small and good looking i 'm about half deaf and every speakers with a separate woofer had too much bass when i turned the volume up so i could understand human speech i 'm happy i spent the money these are real quality in my opinion,1
133,i tried all the rubber vinyl plugs that came with the 's but they all had the shortcoming of not effectively sealing the ear canal making bass very poor and they were uncomfortable the yellow foam plugs are easy to use and work just like the ear foams many people use in industrial applications they effectively seal the ear canal and are very comfortable although they seem a bit expensive i 've found that once they get dirty you can use water and a bit of dish detergent to clean them just soak squeeze rinse and let them air dry and they are as good as new you can do this three or four times then just toss them away highly recommended,1
134,pluged it in and good to go i skipped the installation disk in fear of what nonsense is loaded on that went to the admin screen a little overwhelmed with all the features it could be more stremlined for a novice user they would be entirely lost perhaps that is whats on the install disk easier setup but my experience self got through just fine enabled the maximum security features more so then the easy setup button which itself is good but does not suffice my network requirments heard lots of issues was weary but out of the box works great no issues no dropped connections and for that reason since it works i do not intend to flash the firmware to the latest as the saying goes if it isnt boke do n't fix it btw home network is a mix of print server wired pc wireless apple powerbook everything running smoothly,1
135,before you buy this drive be sure to google cypress '' and western digital '' until yesterday i recommended this drive to everyone then my drive failed prompting me for new hardware and to install a driver for cypress it appears that there is a chip in the drive housing manufactured by cypress that is failing in drives left and right class action suit anyone the western digital support staff is no help act like they have never heard of this error offer no option to just switch out the housing will replace but you lose all the data there are 30 replacement housings available but you void your warranty bottom line if you buy this drive be prepared for it to fail keep everything backed up because there will come a day that this drive will fail,0
136,i had a very poor experience with the microsoft media center infrared keyboard and i wanted to replace it with a bluetooth solution that would i thought get rid of all connection problems i was wrong the hardware is very nice but the software keeps on dropping connections as usual i was very careful i always read manuals and properly install the software before using any product i do n't want to fail the installation for a very simple reason the package does n't come cheap i am a software developer i have half a dozen computers at home and i did everything as instructed i found the software to be very average in terms of usability why do they try to do all these fancy effects but that 's not very important when it works fine unfortunately after just a couple of days the keyboard stopped working i finally managed to get it back by removing the batteries and rebooting the computer both step were required the switch did n't work same thing for the connect button which is totally ineffective now the mouse keeps on dropping connections after a couple of hours of inactivity the mouse simply stops responding this is simply unacceptable logitech knows that this product does n't work and keeps on charging customers for something that is simply not usable because it was n't tested properly it is a very frustrating experience because the hardware is great do n't buy this product you could be very disappointed note that i have seen another installation done by professional windows system administrators that had the exact same problems now do n't get me wrong the hardware is very nice i would highly recommend the logitech vx revolution cordless laser mouse for notebooks which is great and had none of the issues i have mentioned there,0
137,do n't waste your money what iriver does n't tell their customers is that once the battery goes dead the system is useless i will never buy one of their products again and i 'm doing my best to inform everyone out there that they 'll be tossing their money in the trash by purchasing any iriver products my system cost me and it is now as useless as the customer service department at irive,0
138,the first unit could n't even find fm stereo stations it had similar fm specs as the sony tuner it was replacing it was returned as a faulty unit the replacement strde 197 was able to find stereo fm stations which played fine in monoral but were noisy in stereo my 25 year old tuner did an excellent job on fm stereo stations the second unit was returned for a refund sony 's quality is n't what it use to be i bought an onkyo the fm works fine with more features expandability,0
139,i am on my second one and i will be returning this one also both of them worked once and then would not retract fully after that i was so mad i almost threw it against the wall i thought the first one was a defect but then when i got the second one i realized it was a design flaw if you buy the targus one keep your receipt because i guarantee you will be returning it what i do n't get is how targus has the guts to release this product and also put on it satisfaction guaranteed what a,0
140,unfortunately my wife and i purchased this product '' without reading the posted reviews here all are entirely accurate ! i can not calculate how many hours i have spent trying to figure out what is wrong no loading skipping freezing not opening when it freezes all down the line combined with 100 trips to and from the video stores to exchange their defective '' dvds my wife was firmly of the belief the dvds were just dirty '' but i finally decided this agrees with one of the reviewers there is a balance problem in the drawer when there is a the drawer sometimes not always fixes it but only until the next time and will not stop the freezing problems if my wife had a dime for every time i said this thing is a piece of ! '' she would be a millionaire this is very late but if this product is still on the market in any form stay many miles away and philips ' arrogant lack of response as reported i have no personal experience here is virtually criminal in this day and age,0
141,i 'm very happy with the kensington sx 2000. i listen mostly to jazz and the midrange is as good as the higher end bose or apple speaker systems pumping up the volume does not distort in any way either plus i have my speaker on a divider that equally services both ends of the open space,1
142,there are too many files you must hunt for online that are not on the cd if you can read chinese you may fare better than reading the english instructions for the software i 'm returning mine and will try something a little more expensive but from a company with better quality control,0
143,i read about these headphones in a magazine and i was intrigued by the reviews having a headphone fetish odd i know i decided to order them seeing that they were relatively this is a decision i am thoroughly glad i made these little headphones are absolutely incredible and they even outmatch in quality my larger headphones i have at home the bass is the best i 've ever heard in a headphone rich and deep and true the mids and heights are also brilliantly emulated the mere fact that it is portable with its own compact and innovative carrying case means that you can take the excellent sound with you wherever you go i definitely recommend these pones to anyone who values outstanding quality in their music and games stars,1
144,have had this router for over a year during this time the router constantly lost the internet connection even when it 's wired directly to my desktop pc the disconnect can last anywhere from a couple of seconds to minutes a new firmware 1.23 was released a few days ago for revision a the version of the router i have 's website said the firmware improved reliability '' so i decided to upgrade after flashing to the new firmware the router will not let me into the control panel or respond to pings the lights blink that 's all i 've reset the router but this does nothing to restore the old firmware 's firmware upgrade appears to have put this router out of its misery which is perhaps for the best as it now forces me to finally go back to a reliable router company,0
145,once the speaker of choice for every hard rockin ' audiophile with a big enough garage klipsch fell off the landscape for a while after being sold to a corporate conglomerate that did n't know the real value of what they 'd bought but after another buyout by a small group of genuine audiophiles klipsch is back on top from a sound quality standpoint and it shows in the promedia 2.1 thx i have my trio connected to a new mac pro desktop unit and the sound is absolutely magical yes there are more complex with 5 or 7 speakers spread out across the room but if you just want the magic without the madness the klipsch promedia 2.1 thx is an incredible and very affordable solution that 's quick and easy to configure in about 5 minutes of course there are other desktop systems by makers like logitech cyber acoustics and intec but here 's the difference klipsch is a true speaker company that connects great speakers to your computer while those others are computer peripherals companies that one day decided to make speakers not the same thing the only brands that are true competitors to klipsch in this area are bose harman kardon jbl and altec lansing i find that the altec lansing and jbl sets both sound nasal and tinny '' on the high end while the bose and harman kardon sets sound great but are more expensive so after a good look and listen around i went with klipsch in any case this is an incredible sound for your music player and should not be overlooked enjoy,1
146,the things i like most 1. my recorded greetings two greetings allowed and my caller 's messages are clear and clean 2. the unit 's appearance and styling is sleek and modern the controls layout is good with everything in view and accessible on the top my last machine had some of its controls on the sides causing me to have to pick it up and turn it around and around looking for a particular control this machine is better in that respect 3. learning to use it is a very easy and intuitive process especially if you have used other machines the included instructions clearly explain how to use its less obvious features things i did n't like nothing really but some minor annoyances include 1. the electronic accent of the generated voice of the machine was a little hard to understand at first but i quickly learned '' its accent your callers will never hear it after you record your own greeting which will be clear and sound like you otherwise your callers will hear a default message in the machine 's voice 2. i installed the 9 volt battery first and the unit would not turn on when plugged into ac removing the battery then plugging in the ac then installing the 9 volt battery allowed it to power up and work normally the battery installation instructions and general installation instructions did not indicate any particular installation sequence requirements regarding the battery,1
147,i really wanted to like this mouse but so far it has given me nothing but grief if you plan on leaving your computer on for extended periods of time and then coming back to it to do some work you may find that your scroll wheel no longer scrolls pages i have had to on several occasions unplug and replug in my mouse in order to get the scroll wheel working again this is absolutely unexceptible logitech ! what happened to logitech you used to be able to count on them for quality products now i am wondering if i should switch back to micro oft products i may give the micro oft laser mouse 6000 a try and take the mx 400 back,0
148,for the background i 've owned used various iem headphones over the years ety altec lansing shure sony koss here 's my quick impression after using these headphones for a week pros 1. very good bass well balance not as bloated as the sony the has tight but the least is good treble is just a little bit harsh right out of the box but can be tamed with eq 2. easy to drive with the phones i 'd need to crank up the vol 3. very light weight 4. comfortable tips 3 sizes included 5. decent isolation from outside noise the have better isolation 6. moderately priced 50 cons 1. cables are thin so handle with care 2. some people may not like the phonendoscope effect '' cables frictions this is very common with iem headphones some are more than others 3. no pouch or case ps for you will like these iems from an owner of beyer 's experience,1

157,be aware before you buy this flash drive that it will not accept file names with many commonly used characters like ' ' and ' when it encounters these characters it stops transferring files completely and you have to begin the copying process again after 'correcting ' the file names for me this was a serious inconvenience and an undisclosed liability of the device for others it may be less important,0
158,people buy expensive av cables because of most people would think that more expensive cables will work better and last longer i 've found that it 's more a matter of quality control i 'll roll the dice with cheap price cables untill they fail on me,1
159,i just bought a new ratpadzgs to replace my four year old ratpadz compaired to the old ratpad the ratpadzgs is made with a lower density tm plastic and tracks poorly with my logitech mouse when using the mouse on the gs it causes the curser to sort of stutter along overall i would pass on this product for now my desk actually works better than this mousepad,0
160,i purchased 2 cards for about us 42 for my psp they work i had other sandisk products and dont have any complaints best of all these cards came with the adapter memory stick pro duo to memory stick so i could use it with my videocamera its nice when one company starts addresing the multiple formats problems,1

166,i 've loved these headphones for the year or two i 've had them i still love them now when they work the problem is that the cord is shoddy when i plug into my laptop i have a hard time keeping it working i have to twist the cord just right to get the sound to work if its not just right i 'll get sound in only one ear if at all i do n't think this happened because of any handling issues seeing as how the base just sits on my desk i do n't think it has ever left my office and i do n't tend to put items on top of the wire that might crush it overall i like these things but i 'm just getting sick of the sound phasing in and out when my laptop moves the slightest bit,0
167,i do not recommend sennheiser 's headphones first the good features 1. as with all sennheiser products these earphones deliver first rate sound for its price range 2. the earphones are very comfortable and easy to fit properly using the included pads 3. once inserted in the ear these earphones will not fall out due to vibration movement or sweating however the cord has ugly problems 1. the cord is unusually stiff and consequently tends to be tough to manage this is especially true when the phones are first removed from the package as the cord maintains a sort of corkscrew shape for quite some time 2. the cord running to the right earphone is substantially longer than the one connecting to the left earphone the result is annoying slack around the face and neck 3. the cord is the ugliest possible shade of green all in all should sennheiser offer a new product using the same earphones but with conventional wiring i 'll be a buyer until then i 've given up on using these lime green annoyances,0
168,this was the largest set that would fit into my space i also looked at the westinghouse 37 inch hd moniter at best buy the first time i looked at the westinghouse the picture looked a bit fuzzy then i read the review on cnet which said the westinghouse picture was actually better than the sharp i went back to best buy and asked the sales person if the picture on the westinghouse could be improved he said it was as it good as it could be he than said the sharp was twice the price of the westinghouse so i should expect a better picture on the any event i purchased the sharp on amazon during the recent electronic express sale on hd the picture is amazing it 's also quite good on regular tv my only regret is that toshiba has just come out with a lcd with a dvd built in if i had known i would have waited to check out that model,1
169,do n't get me wrong this is a pretty clever gadget however it 's mising one thing in terms of usability an switch this really limits the usability of both since it 's typical to want to turn the flashlight off for a moment or the laser pointer on for a moment i ca n't see me using this laser pointer in a real presentation since it 'd either be on all the time or i 'd be pulling the light in and out all the time neither of which make me look cool so if you 're going to buy this keep this limitation in mind,0
170,i purchased this wireless card based on the price figuring that even if it did n't live up to the good reviews here i would only be out 20 the set up was easy and smooth but the card wo n't stay connected to my wireless network i 've got a belkin wireless router the trendnet signal meter generally shows signal strength but the connection only lasts for a few minutes and i have to keep cycling the connection to regain network access very annoying i know there 's nothing wrong with the network because my laptop 's connection is stable i purchased a card and it has worked flawlessly unfortunately i threw away the packaging when the trendnet card arrived if i had n't then this card would be on its way back to amazon now like the title of my review says you get what you pay for,0
171,i had a small 512 sandisk a while back so when i saw a review for the titanium cruzer in a popular computer mag i decided to upgrade from my lexar so far i 'm very impressed just did a transfer that took 140 seconds i was a big leery of the included software but was pleased to see that if i did n't care for it it was easily removed i have not had an issue with either the software or the drive and am very impressed with the design of the retractable interface that requires pressure to expose or retract this is a very good drive and contrary to the negative comments i would encourage anyone looking for a fast stylish practical jump drive to seriously conside the titanium cruzer,1
172,mine worked great for the first few months then i started getting the warning check battery '' if you take the batteries out and reinsert it works for a few hours but then the same warning message comes up it happened on both headsets i called customer service and they told me this is the first time they 've ever heard that uh huh does n't sound like it from the reviews here a little too expensive to replace,0

176,amazon has a nice price on the jbl duet speakers july 2006 36.95 dealmac is a site i used and returned to amazon i purchased these for my office desk where i wanted a crisp sound for low volume daily listening anything from ambient to rock and jazz they produce sounds nicely nice tight crisp if these came with a woofer unit these would be ideal speakers as the alone do not produce any significant bass at all just the hints '' of bass in the music but no thud if that 's what you are hoping for i did turn these up loud to listen to their full sound and they do sound good these are perfect for offices and just daily music sound is superb not for audiophiles or for people who are expecting to shake everything on their desks build quality is ok '' i got the white speakers and they are the nice mac '' white plastic the jbl logo on the speaker itself is awfully big and the silver volume knob is made of that cheap silver flake paint over plastic which is abit tacky one of the soft rubber pads on the bottom of these meant to not scratch your desk did fall off during opening but they are glued on so no big deal in placing it back on the design is very modern and cool tho they look nice on my desk you will need to keep these on for abit to let the speakers fully break in they sound awful right out of the box and after maybe one hour of keeping these on they will sound better on the low end of speakers out right now these will probably sound the best and are most modern design compared to the black boxes out there,1
177,the first warning sign is that the drivers are not windows approved and unsigned their installation instructions advise you to ignore the warnings next is the cheesy cool '' looking program please forget about the groovy graphics and just provide a usable interface then the drivers do n't work my cursor slides all around the screen after i stop moving the mouse i tried calling customer support but there is no telephone support i then tried connecting with their online chat support no one helped me after 20 minutes two days later in response to an they sent me 3 pages of instructions about how to adjust my system to accommodate their crappy software too bad because the mouse itself is a nice piece of hardware and comfortable i 'm sending mine back for a refund,0
178,have been using them for a week now incredible sound for the size bass is incredible mids are accurate highs are accurate these are the way to go if you 're using an player i use them with the creative zen vision m 30 the ipod killer '' while walking riding a bus or train in in seals out external noise amazingly very well ! ! ! pros awesome accurate sound incredibly light do n't protrude out of your ears comes with 2 sets '' of three different sizes of silicone plugs plugs are ultra soft comfortable and fit perfectly secure well built storage case cleaning tool barely uses battery power ! not the white color much cooler black ! cons none so far i bought them directly from amazon for 75.99 with free '' 4 day ultra fast shipping,1
179,i recently purchased this item from amazon what i received was version 2 of this modem the current version on the linksys site is version 4. as a cox customer the results of my purchase were unsatisfactory i will be returning this and purchasing the version 4 linksys from another vendor,0
180,the device is well built but has one major flaw the adhesive comes in 2 types removable '' and permanent '' types neither adhesive would stick to the dash of my jeep liberty i 'm not sure what i 'm going to do with it now it appears as though i 'm going to either have to find a more permanent mounting solution or find another type of adhesive,0
181,i 'm overly critical of sound quality at home i have the tritton surround sound headset running off optical connection this doesnt ' compare to that but the tritton is 99 too for the this is really nice sound microphone and wire quality are all good controls are easy to use and the software is easy to use too they 're also fairly comfortable good headset for work,1
182,the matte photo paper that i received was really poor quality no matter what setting my printer was set to the ink ran together and created a really low quality photo i do not recomend this item,0
183,not a particularly easy lock to use combo part rotates freely when not in computer making it difficult to set the combo also changing combo is very easy to do accidently however this is usually not a problem because it is incredibly easy to figure out the combo i am not a professional lock picker and i am able to break the combo without any difficulty which is a problem with many low quality combo locks but this design try to avoid it at all i 've noticed a lot of people have a problem with the lock spontaneously '' changing combinations it 's probably not because the lock is defective it 's probably because they inadvertently changed the combination because the mechanism to change it is so easy to engage i would definitely never suggest this product to anyone unless i really wanted their computer,0
184,printers have gotten inexpensive let 's face it the game is cheap printers and then the consumer buys cartridge after cartridge of ink refills i 'm fine with that for the 149 amazon price this machine actually do everything i need it to a fax machine for those rare occasions i need to fax a physical piece of paper a great inkject that does n't consumer much ink it copies and scans i have used every function am pleased with them all sure it feels a little flimsy it is a small machine meant to do work that you are used to seeing a huge piece of hardware accommodate in a standard office however it has held up well to some serious use in the past couple months so that flimsiness is n't really even a complaint and i work from an office in my home three weeks out of each month so i am more than glad i can reproduce all the functionality my real '' office provides me all in all worth the money,1
185,the case itself fits very snug around the ipod and even gives it a better look the only complaint that i have is that the plastic window that covers the dial pops open and even falls off at times i still give the case a 4 star rating because i am a soldier in iraq and this case is doing a very good job of keeping my ipod clean if a product can keep something clean in iraq then i am guessing that it can keep things clean anywhere,1
186,your buying 128 mb worth of frustration and 10 worth of gas from back and forth to i bought my creative muvo and had it for a month or so loved it had everything i needed great worked great one day plugged it in to put a song on it and all of the sudden it starts smoking big hole in it from all the smoke so i return it at walmart for a new one two days later i plug it in my usb to put a song on it smokes again ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i returned it and got my money back got an ipod shuffle buy that much better player wont start on fire,0
187,you may notice i am writing this in lowercase i am using the keyboard i bought over a year ago the shift keys suddenly went out so the keyboard is now useless i have to subtract for longevity the mouse that comes with the keyboard is poor but i use it with another mouse anyway and as noted in other reviews this in common with most other usb keyboards only works with basic functionality when hooked up through a usb kvm switch on the good side the battery life is very good and i think it looks nice but i 'll be looking for something else for a,0
188,i bought this even with the bad reviews i have one of it 's predecessors a black one and it worked fantastically for 5 or 6 years it still does but the button finally died i figured how bad could it be the one i have worked great until now it 's bad it 's awful it 's worthless i 've had to enter the codes for my tv and vcr 3 times today the batteries are brand new that 's the first thing i tried do not buy this i only gave it a 1 because you ca n't give it a zero,0
189,for some years i tried this and other monster products to the tune of over 1000 in monster gear the more you learn about video and audio the more you 'll avoid anything with the monster label specifically this meets no ntsc dvd or ieee standard it is common hookup wire with ineffective shielding and a poorly designed connect plug that can wreck your input jacks and gives poor grounding has a sharp image but includes a catalog of chromatic aberrations from skin tones to color blotching dirty grays burned highlights murky shadows noisy reds and poor color balance due to impedance mismatching that results in cyan errors and bleeding reds makes video test patterns look great but who watches test patterns all day amazon offers many other brands at good prices why waste your on this stuff i removed every piece of monster from my system and replaced them with ar belden viewsonics and others from amazon result vast improvement in every respect,0
190,having a tv in the car make the a little easier obviously the driver ca n't watch it but the passengers can all of the chords and connectors are included great price,1
191,this is a product too unique for me not too try i 've struggling with lost receipts and always in a panic mode when tax day comes there 's just no other easy way i 've found to keep track of all my receipts even with some of the negativity about the accuracy on the receipt recognition i still wanted to try this out for myself i noticed the following will increase the accuracy of the receipt scanning 1 scan your receipt asap once you have it receipts are pretty cheap in quality and will fade over time also for that matter you risk the chance of loosing the receipt the longer you do n't scan it in SMILE 2 ink quality on the receipt matters it does the best job when the dots of the are together and dark 3 wording on the receipt the receipt can say then scanner will pick it as visa business card scans have been excellent for me be sure to upgrade your sw to the lastest version mine is 2.55 at the time of writing,1
192,i like the light that goes on when the phone rings but that is about all i like about this phone friends tell me i sound like i am under water and i have had to terminate many conversations due to static and interference one friend insists that i have a microwave running as we speak i am actively looking for a new set to buy because these are worthless,0

197,i would highly recommend reading the businessweek review on this product that came out on september 12 2005. businessweek as reviewed all the major gps navigation options on the market and ranks the cobra nav one 4500 as number one here is an excerpt from the businessweek article '' cobra 's nav one 4500 and garmin 's streetpilot 2720 which each sell for 800 to use a more straightforward approach the traffic info travels along with fm radio broadcasts from clear channel stations in 48 of the top 50 markets an fm antenna and receiver pick it off the air and feed it to the navigation system '' i preferred the cobra mostly for its big bright screen and its radio receiver the garmin receiver is 200 extra and needs to be installed between your car antenna and radio when you encounter traffic a on the screen and a voice give you three options keep driving reroute me or give me a couple of new routes and let me pick one,1
198,the belkin cassette adapter was my attempt at a product that would allow me to play my ipod through car cassette deck the first product can you say monster here was crap stopped working properly after two weeks the belkin adapter has performed flawlessly for months now,1
