1,i have read all of van gulik 's murder mysteries and this is has to be my favorite the characters are intriguing and some sinister the end is satisfying and bittersweet challenging integrity vs justice i would however recommend you read the others first chronological is good chinese gold murders is first to get to know the main characters although this book can stand on on its own,1
2,there are two things which tickle me about this book one is the sample zack 's report at the back which has a strong buy 1 rating on a return on equity stock the other is the section on practical use of the system it of course is for any type of investor including long term investors even though the effects that the system measures lasts only for 1 3 months and do n't forget about growth investors and value investors either this section is so short as to be laughable also notice that in the 2002 a list there were 216 stocks most are going to have to buy a subset but what subset no info is provided on the performance of typical subsets for each investor class perhaps an mvo addict or a monte carlo hack would have the answer,0
3,john little and peter sisco wrote static contraction but john takes it a step further and eliminates the need for doing reps with scientific explanations to back up his revolutionary concept of weight muscle my girlfriend and i started doing this method in may of 2005 and i can honestly say i 've never found such a fast quick and easy way to build muscle this is also a great method for those not wanting to spend hours in a gym after a while you only need to workout once a week but do n't forget to stretch afterwards and do n't forget to do cardio on other days i 've never been able to develop the abs until i used the techniques in this book not to mention all the other muscles popping out that i never knew were there before ! i do n't entirely agree with his take on supplements although i think he 's referring to all the stupid gimmicks out there designed to waste your time and money apparently he 's not familiar with shaklee,1
4,it is juust a copy of the frist book if you read the frist the world is flat then do n't waste your time jo,0
5,my problem was that these books were missing chunks of pages ! we did n't notice it until book 4 of 6 but pages were gone ! now amazon was great about replacing the set adn paying for me to return the set this is just a warning to check your boxed set when it gets in for missing chunks of pages ! of course the harry potter series is great adn we love having them in paperback,0
6,as an adult i picked this up for my teen daughter and read through it and laughed and truly valued the advice within and wished i had it when i was a teen also a lot of this advice will work for any age i loved the advice for falling down the stairs,1
7,have you ever read a book that just seemed to drag on and on for me that was this book if you like fantasy then you might like this because that is the genre of this book it is about a jewish girl named hannah she goes to a family party and hears a knock on the door she opens it and then sort of wakes up and she thought it was a dream she now has a new name chaya she now has to figure out what happened and what she will do in this body it takes place in new rochelle it is old times it does n't give a specific time but you can infer by the clues and setting she does n't know why this happened to her but she must try to fix it i did n't like this book at all i thought it was really hard to follow you have to pay attention throughout the whole book you can never daydream or you wo n't know why they are calling her a new name this was definitely made for older adults or people with a higher reading level if you are a good reader and you like to challenge yourself try this book i do n't recommend this book if you are younger or just not that well of a reader this is for very and i mean very good and high level readers i would say between the ages of might like this book i do n't think this book was a page turner i wanted to put it down instead of not wanting to put it down it never sparked my interest her being jewish and the book being a fantasy i could n't relate to anything that happened this book was hard to concentrate on if you look up for one second you miss most of the story so concentrate hard i could n't relate to anyone i am not jewish if you are jewish you might actually understand this book better than i could i did n't like the genre it was all fake and totally unrealistic if you like that sort of stuff then read this book but i do n't like fantasy i did n't like how it was written it was too hard to concentrate on i had to reread twice to find out why they are calling her a different name i never found any surprised in the story i could guess what would happen next it was predictable none of the chapters had cliffhangers if just was boring and that 's it i thought it was extremely boring i did n't understand anything and i would rather do my homework than read that book my mind wandered a lot i had to read sections over and over again i never believed the plot one bit with the story being fantasy everything is farfetched i think older people would enjoy this book because they would be the only ones who could understand it,0
8,deadly feasts tracking the secrets of a terrifying new plague by richard rhodes is one scary book it tracks the discovery of prions the mishapen proteins responsible for mad cow disease scrapie and creutzfeldt jacob disease following human cannibals in the jungles of new guinea in the fifties bovine cannibals of the british isles in the eighties and the bizarre history of sheep scrapie from the century on rhodes does a great job of presenting the history and discovery of this bizarre group of diseases i especially enjoyed the characterizations of the scientists from the noble laureate who so enjoyed the new guinea that he often regretted rejoining civiliziation yet brought thirty natives back to the usa and helped them through school to the scientist who named the molecules even though he was n't quite certain what they were but this is n't just a story of scientific discovery as the foreboding subtitle blares rhodes explores some of the scarier aspects of prions these include spontaneous formation responsible for the known early cases of creutzfeldt jacob disease infection including mad cow disease and scrapie the long long incubation period and lack of immune system response and hardiness of the disease one scary factoid a scientist took a sample of scrapie froze it baked it for an hour at 360 degrees celsius and was able to other animals from this sample for all the uneasiness this book inspires it certainly does n't offer any answers a condemnation of industrial agriculture a warning that it 's unknown whether vegetarians are even safe and a caution against using bone meal for your flower garden do not make a recipe for handling this issue to be fair it was printed in 1997 perhaps things are under control now,1
9,all over the place confusing poorly organized i was unable to read this book and would love to return it bad very bad,0
10,this book is not only interesting but gives a great deal of insight into life on death row '' at least in the state of mississippi and the appeals process involved with stays of execution and commutation of sentences it touches on activities of the ku klux klan it was my impression that the author leans toward those who favor the abolition of the death penalty however some sympathy is found for the victims of crime the story centers on sam cayhall who is sentenced to death after several trials over a number of years following the crime sam 's grandson becomes his attorney during the last months of appeal from death row '' the latter part of the book leaves one wondering whether or not there will be an execution meanwhile sam shows repentance and response to the prison 's chaplain i found it to be one of the better john grisham books,1
11,this novel '' would be better suited for the stage it reads like a play often it 's not realistic as the author goes overboard in depicting high drama '' within a family they suffer a tragedy that would certainly affect a family but to the extent the author has them changing is not realistic at all there are far too many scenes of shouting histrionics the father goes from being ward cleaver to a verbally abusive monster if i had to see the mother one more time with her calling robin ! '' i was going to scream the author needs to understand that high drama and a climax will be inferred by the reader after seeing the conflict this author forces the climax onto us in every scene he 's desperate for this end result of angst high drama and shock it 's overkill i do n't believe that a 14 year old would become this promiscuous sure it happens but this was the leave it to beaver family at first it just does n't make sense that because of one incident all members of the family devolve into sordid disasters in short the author needs to be focused more on telling a story allowing the reader to infer instead he thrusts high drama and climax onto us at every turn it 's ironic actually as he 's trying to make us feel drama but he did it so much that i just felt tedium very very contrived and forced novel not believable i do not recommend,0
12,the winner and absolute truth made me continue reading baldacci last few books christmas train and split second were baldacci takes his left leaning anti american feelings and tries to shove it down our was the last money i ever spend on a baldacci book i even threw out his good books shut up baldacci and write fiction books your ideas do not get through in this non fiction world,0
13,an excellent overall guide for both beginners in weight training and women who are familiar with their local gym ! in this book you will find weekly workout plans laid out clearly for you as well as other lifesyle suggestions to meet your health and goals,1
14,i picked up this book hoping to fall asleep reading instead i was drawn in by page 3 and stayed up until i 'd read most of it the main character in my opinion is janet the mother i think it 's more or less in her voice and that is why she is the most developed character the book was very funny in an oh no ! '' kind of way sure there are some outrageous stories and some things may seem unlikely to some people they are lucky i guess i for one can really relate to the dysfunctional family and to a lot of the characters but it is n't meant to be a character study or some huge philosophy assignment it 's meant to entertain you while you pass some time reading and it does that just fine,1
15,gods and generals is an extremely well done and fascinating book the author jeff shaara did an excellent job of interpreting the characters his task was a difficult one because his father 's book the killer angels is a classic in the chronicles of civil war stories this book precedes the one written by his father gods and generals takes the reader to the beginning of the civil war and through many of the battles the major players in the story are winfield scott robert lee stonewall jackson winfield hancock and lawrence chamberlain the career biographies of these famous men were striking after reading of their early lives and service experiences it gave me a better understanding of just how horrible a civil war was to all of these men who had formerly served together in the union army they were an outstanding group of soldiers and the sadness that they all faced was to go to war against fellow soldiers and friends i listened to the unabridged books on tape version read by dick estell he brought the characters to life by his narration this book is well worth the time and truly is an unforgettable part of our history,1
16,after reading this book and reading the readers ' reviews to this book it is evident that there are '' who do not understand hooks ' point and the basic notion and theory behind racism my suggestion is that if you are white you should explore the topics of racism power and class before attempting to understand the depths of which hooks is writing,1
17,i love this book i listened to it on tape the storey started out a tiny bit slow but oh is the story good ! i recommend this book to anyone who likes romance not real graphic but very sweet and suspense oh this book is so good hammond cross is the ideal man and lad is just as sweet and classy as can be the end is the best hammond struggles with doing what is right and what is ethical very good book ! two thumbs up to brown !,1
18,we live in a man 's world women are raped abused beaten and generally regarded as objects for male gratification this is an epidemic problem and christian men are just as great of offenders as the general population so here comes another book on male sexuality for christian men the idea is good rein in the beast but the major defect which sinks the book is the nature of the remedy christian men are given a toolkit to not look at booty what we are not given is a concrete understanding of compassion it 's all who cares if the world is just as dangerous for our wives daughters and loved ones at least i 'm sexually pure '' surely sexual purity includes overthrowing the sexual aggression in society at large this is a life and death situation we will be successful according to the goals we set it is not enough for men to stop lusting we need to fundamentally change the sexual ethics of our society ethics that are n't greatly concerned with women 's if you 're only concerned with your own thoughts this book could be useful but what about the sense of security for the women in our society who have to live with sexual aggression and '' s this book sets shamefully low standards for the church 's role in reshaping society even as it sets admirably high standards for individual men 's,0
19,never received the book so very disappointed at the delivery process and cost i have incurred,0
20,this book tells us the truth that has been hidden from most citizens for so many years each chapter tells about a different regime change given us all the dirty little details names and places of the participants this book helped me and will help all of us to finally understand why they hate us '' i only regret that their is not a sequel,1
21,this book irritated me on many levels not that the writing was poor or the plot weak in fact the plot the premise the writing were good unfortunately the characters did n't pull it off or keep me interested because they were all kinda indifferent or unlikable i read somewhere the number one reason people keep reading a work of fiction regardless of plot is because they care about someone in the book in this book i was hoping they would all drown by the end of the story,0
22,this book hardly has any conversation in it and hardly goes into detail about anything i did n't even like the story i would give this book a big fat zero if i could ! !,0
23,what a complete and utter waste of time its obvious how these guys got dubbed the nutroots,0
24,although interesting these are designs and concepts that are not practical in the real world but if all you want are some pretty,0
25,i bought this book because my mother is dying and i needed to know more kessler has a wonderful way of delivering this knowledge he is thorough in imparting this knowledge and does so with total compassion for the dying and the living i underscored many passages in this work and especially appreciated someone telling me chapter 8 what can i expect in the way of physical signs as mom goes through the dying process this book is very user friendly having a very readable quality i strongly recommend it,1
26,i have read all of the artimis fowl books and loved them until now i was disapointed with this one and not found artmis unusaly irritating but felt the whole book was the lacking the charm and wit that had made the other three so good truth be told i was younger when i read the first three but still i can reread them and enjoy them as i did after reading the fourth and being very disillusioned with the whole seris so if you want my advice then i suggst you do n't buy this book and let the magic of the first three live in peace,0
27,'' first grade takes a is an excellent multicultural book that should be in every elementary classroom especially kindergarten thru grades for use in demonstrating that the really important things in life measurable and even as a tool for helping students understand and interpret poorly worded questions and there will always be a handful of them on any standardized test the book is invaluable highly recommended from this early childhood teacher,1
28,having patronized boulevard all but twice i still feel the need to write a review you have to understand that those of us back east '' think that california food is understated and so easy now not being a huge chef myself but cooking a bit and doing some experimentation and emulation of real chef 's recipes my fave restaurants being of course boulevard and back east 2941 le tire bouchon maestro citronelle dc galileo inn at little washington i have no clue where i 'd get some of the ingredients in this cookbook other than maybe the san francisco ferry building 's fabulous farmer 's market another real sf treat ! but to be real we have to sometimes improvise on ingredients do what you can with what you have locally and you might be surprised now i was spoiled with a fabulous waiter at boulevard who asked the chef to let me know what was in one of the recipes and i have her handwriting just ingredients no measurements and yes i 've been able to improvise and her very treasured scribe is in my own personal collection of recipes '' but nothing is better than going to the restaurant cookbooks are fab and fun but getting the realy cooked food directly from the professionals herselves are even more exciting buy this book even just for the photographs as i 've never been in a more and restaurant if only i did n't live on the east coast !,1
29,this is most definitely my favorite book on earth ! i 'm so serious this is such a cool book it really appeals to anyone kids could read it because there are short sentances and pictures some tough words though start with epiplectic but teens and adults i 'm sure can also appreciate the morbid and brilliant humor of edward gorey for anyone that thinks that 10 is too much to spend on a little book you may be right in some circumstances but this is such a fantastic book i know i am gushing but i love it soooooooo much ! ! !,1
30,i 've read some of the negative reviews listed for this title and i must strongly disagree malphurs ' work here is the best treatment of strategic planning for churches i have found to date in place of the term advanced '' in the title a better word would be comprehensive '' nonetheless malphurs here provides a handbook addressing church planning that is unrivaled today in breadth and insight as a pastor of twenty years i wish this book had been available when i first started in ministry i hope this title is now offered in many seminaries because its content would be a gold mine for young church leaders pastors church staff members and lay leaders this volume is a in my opinion it is required reading for anyone involved in church leadership,1
31,i was a little disappointed maybe i should have shopped through a book store,1
32,of all the articles and books of chomsky that i have read necessary illusions thought control in democratic societies is without doubt the most exhaustively researched and footnoted the most logically structured and the most convincing chomsky reminds us that the majority of the populace rely on the various media institutions for their information about political affairs both domestic and foreign one can only hold an opinion on a topic if one knows about the topic so take for example the popular myth of the 'persistent soviet vetoe ' at the un during the cold war why do people believe the ussr was constantly vetoeing any and every security council resolution simple ! when they did it generated front page condemnation when the us or the uk exercised their right of veteo silence as chomsky notes during the years of 1970 and 1989 the former soviet union veteod 8 resolutions the us veteod some 56. this is what chomsky refers to as thought control unless the public examine the factual record of the un themselves they will never come by this information at least not in the mainstream press so although chomsky 's title may appear somewhat paradoxical or oxymoronic a moments reflection on such facts shows it to be in fact extremenly pragmatic and truthful the question is have you the honesty and sheer guts to question yourself and challenge the information which has contributed to your beliefs the crux of chomsky 's argument is that propaganda is to a democracy what violence is to a dictatorship chomsky points out that in fact propaganda is contrary to popular postulations more important and vital to a democratic society because people still have some rights that is since people can talk the powers that be must ensure that only the correct words come out of the peoples ' mouths in a dictatorship it does not really matter too much what people think for whatever they may think they have to do what they are told by pain of death in countries such as the us and the uk other more subtle methods are required people often critisise chomsky for the sources of his information the copious footnotes no such critique can be levelled at this work chomsky 's sources are declassified internal planning documents naval proceedings documents and the very institutions he examines new york times washington post etc if there was one chomsky book i would suggest you to read this would be it,1
33,i admire an author who deviates from a standard formula and the interweaving of two cases really works in piece of my heart '' di stanley chadwick faces a murder case in 1969 against the backdrop of a rock 'n roll concert his teenage daughter has facts to hide and di chadwick walks a fine line dci alan banks is seeking a murderer in 2005 which eventually connects with the 1969 murder the plot has already been outlined so i 'll just say it 's a delight to visit dci banks again i 'm never disappointed,1
34,i first read passages from this book in college i can now see how liberal professors very much enjoy using this book to influence young minds professor zinn is a far left author he uses the usual lines america generally bad communism generally good obviously zinn has the right to write whatever he wants and his writing style is very convincing however if the reader investigates the facts many holes become visible in his theories those who agree and disagree with his writings should explore opposite viewpoints a good example is intellectual morons how ideology makes smart people fall for stupid ideas by daniel flynn '' which gives the reader a good profile of zinn,0
35,i liked this prep guide because it 's not one of those huge books that 's impossible to fit in your or laptop bag if you 're traveling it has enough information to pass the test which is good enough for me because that 's all i needed to pass the test this month but if you 're one of those people who has a need to get every single question right this is not the book for you the book does n't cover every single thing you need to know for the exam just enough to pass it the only draw back to this book is that it does n't come with a cd with a comprehensive set of sample test questions i had to go to one of those huge books that i bought a couple of years ago for that but i did n't read the huge book,1
36,this is a kids book first few had my attention but since then its getting worse with each book,0
37,what a disappointment ! based on reviews i could n't wait to get this book do n't let the 48 pages fool you half of the pages are pictures and the half with writing on them are with wide margins took me all of 20 minutes to read and only that long because of all the page turning nothing wrong with being concise that the philosophy here is overly simplified quindlen goes to great lengths to equate pefection '' with conformity '' and condemning it as inauthentic i do believe that women tend to set unrealistic expectations for themselves wanting to be the perfect mother perfect daughter perfect wife perfect businesswoman therefore it creates warm fuzzy feelings to hear someone criticize perfection as being boring '' unfortunately to claim that women do n't make good lawyers businesswomen '' just does n't follow this is not deep reading 20 minutes do n't waste your time,0
38,author la guardia mentions how the lemba of africa have the jewish gene fine ! but when he deals in several pages mind you with the falashas also of africa he never mentions that genetic studies have positively shown these jews not to be descended from the 12 tribes of israel despite the falashas 's longtime rep for possibly being a lost tribe of israel which again has now been 100 disproven through genetic studies,0
39,my son 34 is currently incarcerated he asked for this book so i had it sent to him he holds on to it for dear life and swears had he read this years ago it would have changed his life for the better and he would n't be where he 's at he raved so much he insisted i order one for myself i did in summary what i derived from the reading was one must be callous in this life and put yourself first otherwise you 'll be no more than a stepping stone for others it 's a good book but i oftentimes got lost in all its references to those that preceded us by years fellow inmates that have the book feel the same as my son it 's a bible to them and they refuse to part with it for others to read for fear it will never be returned to them,1
40,i handsold so many copies of this book that my local bookstore accused me of emptying out the warehouse so they could n't order any more reid strives for a journalistic impartiality here but he is so excited by the current evolution of political life in europe that he carries you along i especially love the story of little portugal which has unilaterally decided that drugs are no longer a criminal matter but a medical one the us could learn from that example and from many other european examples in this book when you read the story about ge and honeywell you 'll realize we 're going to have to because they 're going to teach us whether we want to learn or not,1
41,i got this book thinking it might give me some insight into how coach k motivates his teams organizes his practice sessions and instills leadership qualities in his athletes what i got was a less than thrilling of some of his best quotes as seen through the eyes of a local news reporter you 'd have to be a true blue devil fan to like this book i did n't so i gave it to one of my who graduated from duke he likes it,0
42,my only caveat about this otherwise enjoyable installment in the eve dallas series is that the web site did not prominently state i missed it ! that this had previously been published as part of an anthology i made the mistake of only checking the publishing date decided it was a new novella published independently as would be deserved given the track record of the series and ordered it without checking further my bad but a reminder to readers who want to buy everything from the series be sure to read the description carefully enough to determine whether it is a item !,1
43,any beginner or intermediate learner who wants to be enlightened on the basic mechanisms of both computer and its peripheral devices would be laying a good foundation by starting with this book without compromising its concise outlook the coverage of this book is as comprehensive as it is illustrative its updated chapters are although that anyone who currently owns the seventh or even the sixth edition would not be missing much by sticking with either editions despite being labelled how computers work '' the contents of this book are not limited to pcs they covered other related issues like networking multimedia printers software and so on detailed explanations which are frequently complemented by graphics are abundant this book literally takes its reader into the 'engine room ' that keeps a computer running it is an impressive virtual tour on paper ! however if you are an advanced learner this book will be of little use to you in fact there is hardly anything in it that any advanced learner has not come across likewise stalwarts need not invest in it its focus is entirely on the pc with no room for mac the uniqueness of this book is plausible it is a welcomed advantage every pc component as well as peripherals are laid bare it is a resourceful tools for beginners a worthy and dependable guide for any novice,1
44,i found stale recounting of very facts about century technologies and their economics with no insights since it covers the gamut from plastics to jet engines to microprocessors and it 's only 200 pages in a fairly large typeface i was n't expecting historical depth but i was expecting at least one fresh idea i bought it on the strength of a much earlier book by nathan rosenberg about technology in the economy of the century i was disappointed i get the feeling the book is intended as a brief survey for people who just came down in the last shower college freshmen born in the i 'll bet they find it kinda stodgy,0
45,i have been a fan of larry work for years ever since i first stumbled onto his cartoon guide to statistics he covers a subject the way it should be innovations in science and math have moved along together in a historical time line it was this historical approach that made carl sagan 's cosmos series one of the greatest innovations in the effort to popularize science i have long said that we teach science backward we still teach on a century model we start with biology then chemistry and finally physics even when i was in high school i wished that i could take physics before chemistry before i was elected as a school board director i was on our district 's gifted advisory council i made the suggestion that we teach physics before chemistry and then biology last i was immediately shot down by one of the other parents on the basis that sophomores do not have the math courses under their belts to tackle physics so why not teach the math along with the science integrate it no that would make it too relevant i felt vindicated when a friend of mine reported that she attended a lecture by a nobel laureate making the same assertion that i had been making for teach science backwards after all the toughest course out there is least that is what every med student i know has ever said and biochemistry is the new frontier for blockbuster not being the least of these frontiers gonick underscores my assertion about teaching physics first because in this book on chemistry he introduces quantum mechanics which is normally taught as physics on page 28. do n't let he word cartoon '' in larry books fool you into thinking that these are easy fluff surveys of the subjects involved he makes each subject accessible while being entertaining but each book stands on its own as a complete basic survey course of the subject so when i needed to add about two dollars to my order to get free shipping it took me about thirty seconds to find my book i went right to larry gonick,1
46,it is quite rare that a book appears that is this good but this book is so good that even men i am male can should enjoy it a groundbreaking unabashedly feminist wo manifesto the vagina monologues has given voice to countless women in the past ten years and has ushered in a new era of sexual liberation if you are still incredulous ask yourself how many books published hitherto so much as had the word 'vagina ' let alone all the facts thereabout in it a wonderful book,1
47,the quality of this presentation is far above what one normally sees in game '' cookbooks lots of color pictures all recipes tried so far are keepers btw elk substitutes straight across in most of the recipes so its like two books in one,1
48,i just finished reading the handyman 's dream by nick poff i was completely blown away ! this is a great book its about 2 guys who meet one another in small town indiana after the first chapter you will want to have these fellas over for dinner the story is very well written and has alot of innovative things in it that i havent seen in any other gay novels i love the way the author integrates music and songs into the story from the character norma ed 's mother and her quirky comebacks to the wonderful penfield the novel will have you laughing and will touch a place deep inside you that few books do this story also tells of the fears and struggles a gay couple had in the past and one many still have today i love the fact that its very g rated and a good read for not only gay folks but also straight folks anyone who believes in the power of love i wish while growing up i would have had a book like this one to show me that there is such a thing as good healthy gay relationships i highly recommend the handyman 's dream,1
49,this book is mostly hype the writing is not that great japan must be really dying out if the country of some of the world 's great literary giants can award such a prize for such weak work however the book has erotic energy and is fresh in that way if you are a serious reader skip this book,0
50,lies i never hear any kind of news channel favor the left never the media especially fox news has a right wing 100 fact proven beyond any reasonable doubt the republican right wing nut job wackos invented the concept of a liberal bias in the media for political advantage and its simply not true republicans are the worst thing that could ever happen to this country all they know how to do is lie cheat steal and profit off of the suffering of others oh yeah and these religious wing nuts are delusional bigots who think some guy waved a magic wand and invented the universe give me a break this book is 100 lies i actually burned the book after i read it notice the lack of credible sources good job republicans continue to make up news the people are catching on !,0
51,a very good and indept look at andrew jackson the author was very thorough including a very good look at early century american andrew jackson 's a contraverisal president on the good side he defeated the british at the amazing battle of new orleans help in expanding into the west a great soldier clearly loved his wife rachel enough to duel to defend her and was probably the only president who could threaten a state with military force if it tried to leave the union and tough enough to make it happen on the flip side his percusion of indians the trail of tears his many duels makes him a very complex and sometimes hard to understand person but still a great biography,1
52,i agree completely with the becksted review i also noted that it was helpful but i meant it would have been helpful had i read it before i bought the cd this refers to the cd version i did listen all the way to the end i kept thinking there was going to be something but continued to be disappointed i found the analogizes to be strained beyond usefulness evaluating someone 's integrity by the size and shape of the wake they create are their people waterskiing on it it seems to be politically incorrect to come out in opposition to integrity '' in this day and age but frankly this book did n't help me much,0
53,i just read this book cover to cover on a flight back to nyc from barcelona my mouth watered as i read the included reprints of her past reviews of nyc restaurants even after my five days of fantastic spanish cuisine ! but more surprisingly i was drawn in by what seems to be quite an honest glimpse of the nyc restaurant experience seen through the eyes of many characters '' the book left me such respect for the depths that ruth reichl went through in order to dine as the everyday person would experience especially in nyc 's best '' restaurants her recounts made me actually appreciate the research and dedication required to write a truly objective as objective as food tastes get i suppose review a very easy and enjoyable read,1
54,ed hayes exposes himself and one might think that the machine gun style of the book is fantasy but it does n't do justice to the man himself his dedication to his clients is legendary and he spends every working moment thinking and working for them having shared some of his adventures but as a cop i found that he loves cops if it was n't for the fact that he would not have been able to support his interesting lifestyle he would have been one his book covers his life and gives a glimpse into the man and his style he does n't know how to go at half speed and neither does the book his upfront approach is evident he just does n't have time for it 's a quick read and an enjoyable one make sure that you take it with you on vacation ! it will make it more enjoyable,1
55,i read this book it was okay but the story flashed back to much and i could n't folow all of it but i read all of it anyway i would n't recommend it too slow moving and boring because of the flashbacks the movie was the same way,0
56,having read the millionaire next door '' as well as most if not all of the classics in this category i expected experiences with this book there were too many statistics and statistics that contradicted one another not to mention generalizations about various subgroups that try as i did i had to put my copy down and use it at first for a door stop then because the cover art is great i decided leaving it on the coffee table makes a great conversation piece,0
57,the author is certainly writing for a target audience one other reviewer said white female mystics i found the stories of life on the commune then again i was born in berkeley in 1970 so that hippie commune kumbayah stuff reminds me of eating carob when i was a kid and the rest of what i did manage to read alienating am not saying this is a bad book at all just that it 's focus was so narrow that it completely lost my interest the language was so fuzzy and that it just irritated my gen x for lack of a better word postpunk sensibility it 's a shame too as i was really looking forward to this book and hoping it would assist me in reconciling my own struggle between feminism and spirituality c'est la vie,0
58,the audio is delivered in a monotone that almost puts you to sleep not a good thing while drivin,0
59,three of my nephews and my son 's favorite book he wore it out and i had to buy another one,1
60,bought this book hoping for a comprehensive resource of information on hiring a nanny boy were we disappointed as was mentioned in another post the book is nothing more than a glorified outline and half of the book is copies of the forms that are on the disk which forms by the way are in form and are not even fillable,0
61,i think one of my major problems was the level of opinion being shot at the reader in the book but then at times that made the book more entertaining its acerbic opinion of the right how reagan getting elected made her feel stupid about being american a funny british couple the description of small details from each of the characters ' childhood was something i could relate to because i think of that myself there were clever tidbits from anthropology and economics and generally all fields of intellectual inquiry all somehow connected with the patchwork of love and relationships and thus brain meets heart and you end up with something almost like the bible for our times the focus on the main character made it so that every detail about him was described anyway i am rambling so a note about the ending i did find myself thinking this is getting very strange as the book got towards the ending it might have made more sense if nelson actually was interested in the new girl the narrator finds for him and the story then comes full circle it would end in a nice ironic sort of way however his rejecting her makes in my mind for what would be a bad traditional ending i do n't mind this since the one time i wrote a story for a creative writing course i ended up with a terrible traditional ending now could he have been anything other than a mystic i felt that there was some hint towards hinduism and spirituality building up towards the end he mentioned india and hinduism unexpectedly and repeatedly at one point in the book so his becoming a mystic was alluding perhaps to the ashramas and his transition from intellectual worker to a mystical worker to eventually a sage as he attains nirvana and becomes the buddha of our times so in this way an ending emphasizing the spiritual is perhaps the best in line with the book the spiritual is the eternal and only accessible through experience what you do from making a model village in rural africa is transient can never be perfect infighting hunting guns the '' of human nature will come back even in utopia i like the flexible hours work when you want accumulate credits do manual labor once in a while start the day with reading not the end when you are tired siesta fiesta etc no matter how good you are the girl herself is secondary to the book ironic since the book promotes feminism is written by a guy with a female narrator but a male protagonist who she is fixated on and has doubts about but in the end the jesus character is still male while the female goes back to palo alto and takes an average job in service of the savior the man has the final laugh do you favor a better ending,1
62,the book is amazing ! the cd is horrible ! stick to reading the book yourself i have over 45 audio books and this was like listen to a bad commercial i had to turn it off there is no connection between the narrator and the words he is reading they do n't even state who the narrator is ! i recommend the book to anyone the content is life changing,0
63,this book is great ! assuming you already have a ph in political science otherwise this book is best reserved for drop quoting or light reference the author shows bias towards the united states ' form of democracy as is to be expected in such a book the simplistic nature makes the reader annoyed more than informed the childish approach is suited for school children but not as appropriate as other books for real analysis,0
64,but lana wood has a very autobiographical writing style i found wood 's memoir to be incredibly gossipy she speaks for pages upon pages about her own feelings during pivotal times in natalie 's life every here or there it 's nice to have an eyewitness account of what happened at certain times but i 'd rather read about the academy awards for which natalie was being nominated instead of the powerful men in hollywood with whom lana was sleeping there is a lot of as well as a lack of substance in the book 's context after reading this i read suzanne finstad 's natasha and found it to be very thorough and much more detailed about both her personal and professional life i was not a fan of this book in any respect,0
65,first i am a very person raised by a family i really expected to identify with this book while i appreciate the what ina may 's movement accomplished during its time i felt like the book was almost a joke verging more on detailing accounts of an occult community a community of people living on old school buses in the woods delivering each other 's babies the language is terrible is described as psychedelic '' etc one woman even referred to her female parts using the big p '' word while they try to add a personal touch by including individual narrations it sounds more like a compilation of uneducated people describing their birth stories the way they were pressured to believe mentions feeling pain during labor honestly i feel that the pressure of the community was so intense they would n't have admitted to pain if they could also many of the accounts were extremely erotic are encouraged to fondle one another during labor to keep connected and relaxed in some accounts a couple would be making out while a midwife would massage the birthing mother in her laboring parts '' turning the woman on and keeping her relaxed not my cup of tea i had so little respect for the lifestyle and the language of the people that i did n't get much out of the book,0
66,on the way to a conference in new orleans my flight from raleigh to charlotte was cancelled due to mechanical problems and i was booked on a flight to as i boarded the plane with the carolina way '' under my arm a gentleman seated at the front of the plane asked how i was enjoying the book i explained that i had not yet started the book so i could not give an answer the gentleman followed me to my seat and introduced himself as gerald bell the of the carolina way '' myself a carolina fan i was pleased to meet bell as he spent several minutes talking about coach smith whom i have admired for over forty years and the unc basketball program which is presently undergoing a much needed resurgence under coach roy williams bell 's contributions to the book tie coach smith 's leadership philosophy to practical business applications by relating wonderful anecdotal references from carolina 's storied history to today 's business situations surely coach smith given his ability to recruit top players has been criticized by many for his failure to win ncaa championships in the manner of coach john wooden at ucla but winning two ncaa championships winning at a consistency high level unmatched by any program without violating strict ncaa rules and coaching top players that graduated at a +90 rate and have gone on to be successes in their chosen professions underscore the unique successes of coach smith 's system '' teamwork integrity loyalty and hard work are the cornerstones of the carolina way and anyone in the position of managing leading or molding young people today would benefit from reading this book corny as it is at times this book is not just for carolina basketball fans,1
67,this book is so flawed in every which way it is hard to know where to begin first of all we are living in the end times and when jesus comes that 's all she wrote folks there 's no seven years no christians being zapped up etc this is our second chance on earth no tribulation this book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally and does it poorly reading this book made me think that if this was true then what 's the point of trying to be a christian why not just live your life the way you want to and then when people zap out of thin air change your life it 's ridiculous and sends the wrong message plus the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it but i really do n't think the author 's care at this point seeing how many millions they 've made printing lies my recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series then you 'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter and much better writing man not even kirk cameron could save this train wreck,0
68,this is a pretty good book however i would have liked it better if the focus would have remained on the effect of lincoln 's depression on his life and that of his family rather than a psychological perspective,1
69,after reading the first book which was catastropha and reading the second which was really good i thought that the series is taking off i was mistaken the third book is slow and boring you can see very well that stephan king has no idea what so ever where he is going to take that series nothing much is happening and while the second book introduce some interesting ideas the third book just go to the ordinary adventure that you can find and better written as well in dragon lance series or other adventure books also many ideas that were in this book already appear in many king books reading reviews of manuy users on the fourth book which some say is very boring i guess this is where the adventure end for,0
70,this book tries to convince skeptics but seems to spend too much time justifying orthodox perceptions and concepts of prayer and liturgy without addressing fundamental objections,0
71,a must for any afterlife chapter entitled mothers chapter '' is worth the price of the book alone i know it will be hard to put this book down a delightful 2 day read,1
72,and dump it great advice given in a previous review i think the shame '' about this book is that it glosses over some very interesting ideas with in my opinion some wholly unsupported and mostly crap talbot is to the theory of the holographic universe what mark furman was to the guilt of oj simpson whatever truth there is to it will be hidden by his presentation of false evidence '',0
73,if you 're thinking of reading this book let me save you some time do n't i like a good literary read as much as the next guy really and make it a point to read all the pulitzer winners but this book in perfectly plain english sucked there is no plot no beginning middle or end and is so tedious and boring that i actually started reading it from the back forward it did n't help but it did n't make a wit of difference either do your self a favor and skip it,0
74,antonia fraser has written a wonderful account of marie antoinette and the court of versailles that makes you feel you are living at the time a detailed yet understandable explanation of the political and royal intrigues of the time both in france and in europe that lead to the revolution,1
75,this is a 4 cd set of meditations as a companion to the inner temple of witchcraft book using the background of the book the cd 's set up an easy way to work with the material in the book without having to open the book to reference it during the mediations penczak 's voice is perfect as far as i am concerned it does not grate on you nor does it lull you into sleep the light melodic fill is just that filler for the spaces between words and does not distract from the words i found the material covered to be good for meditation and it works well with the material in the book if you find the book to be what you are looking for the cd 's are a good addition i enjoyed the entire presentation and penczak gives us some very well based and solid material boudic,1
76,sorry guys i looked forward to working on recipes from this cookbook due to the very enthusiastic reception it received from the media the graphics of the book are truly beautiful the recipes however hmmm try again i followed a simple recipe for apple crisp and got a bad result i now go to respected standard cookbooks for my apple crisp recipe and the old family favorite always turns out great really people the recipes are not the stuff of greatness graphics great photography great recipes you have got to be kidding,0
77,i liked track of the cat but i did n't love it the idea that the lion is wrongly accused was one i found appealing but the plot was at times predictable the setting was but most of the characters were pretty the clincher though is that i 'm not sure yet just how captivating anna pigeon is as a main character i believe that this is her first story so i do n't want to make a snap judgement but anna is nowhere near as quirkily entertaining as a sherlock holmes or miss marple that would be expecting a lot i know but frankly she is n't even as engaging as say gideon oliver or sharon mccone or brother cadfael and she lacks the depth and power of a harry bosch as i said the jury is still out for me here i liked track of the cat but i was n't wild about it it 's a solid first try and i 'll certainly read another anna pigeon or two before deciding whether or not to go for the whole series i expect most readers will find this opening mystery enjoyable i recommend it but my recommendation is a mild one,1
78,highly recommended ! the text is engaging and very informative clear possibilities for implementation,1
79,i am both astounded and confounded by the reviews here simply put this is the single worst novel i have ever read everything about it the writing the characters the story is godawful here follows an absolutely true story while i was forcing myself to read this drivel i went out on date she and i were discussing how much of a book one should read before giving up on it i was advocating the 25 page litmus and she insisted on at least fifty she did several long train commutes a week to and from work and so read a lot of novels anyway i started describing this book she recognized it immediately and interrupted me saying the bear went over the mountain ! do n't read another word ! if you think it 's bad now it only gets worse if you can believe it ! '' she was right if you feel the need to find out for yourself save your money and borrow it from a friend or the library,0
80,having spent the last year in the near east i found that reading this book gave me an incite that was most helpful to me and my collegues while this book was written about the issue during the 's though it just reared its ugly head once again in the last few months it was as i said a great help to me to understand or at least better understand the arabic way of life and culture with the world attention squarely on the near east we all weather american european or other cultures throughout the world need to know and understand the near eastern mentality culture and to some extend how the islamic religion plays into the everyday life and politics of that area with this book being written by a jewish american and with thomas freidman 's understanding of the near east way of thinking gives the book a credibility others could only hope for i recommend this book to anyone that is a student of the near east politicians and military personnel religious leaders and anyone who wants a better understanding of the near east in general,1
81,i 've read and the book although not it 's full content but randomly i open it and find a surprise each time i just love it,1
82,this book is full of excuses and manipulated data that ignores the ultimate moral responsibility of a society we can correlate joblessness with the number of innercity households that contain black ink pens if we want to while wilson presents an argument in an attempt to educate his words are slanted in such a way that we are left feeling sorry for them '',0
83,i am an avid reader and i will finish a book no matter how difficult it is or how boring it is and i could n't finish this one it was so dry and i could n't connect with any of the characters i was really disappointed,0
84,sure i had fun reading this book but the amazon reviewer who termed it highly speculative '' is understating the case opinion conjecture hearsay and speculation too often take the place of thorough solid documentation and unlike many other amazon reviewers i found mclellan 's tone she alternates between patronizing her subjects the very notion of calling them my girls '' for instance and setting them up primarily as sources of voyeuristic thrills for the herself and the reader is the book dishy and intriguing and flamboyant you bet but is the topic of lesbianism in hollywood here i do n't think so,0
85,i found this book to be full of silly metaphors as if that 's the only way we could relate to twerski it just did n't get me the information i needed perhaps others would find it motivational,0
86,i was excited to see the book with recipes for the 14 super foods '' after reading steven pratt 's book but was very disappointed yes the recipes do use the 14 super foods '' but also use such ingredients as shortening cheez whiz and yellow cake mix hardly healthy ! if you are interested in eating good healthy meals made with the 14 super foods '' do n't buy this book,0
87,lords of the earth '' is the term the yali warriors use to describe themselves they live in the heluk valley in irian jaya and the only knowledge of them to reach the outside world are the dark rumors of the cannibals beyond the mountains the first section of the book is about them their customs and the awful fear and darkness they lived in don richardson does a great job portraying a people bound by chains of sin and longing for release the horror of their pain is graphic and not suitable to be read to younger children the second part of the book describes the early life of stan dale his conversion and his burden for those in darkness he is drawn as a determined man physically strong and fit with firm convictions the book goes on to tell of stan 's coming to the yali people how a strange story begins over his identity protecting his life how the first few yali christians were killed and later stan and a fellow missionary were brutally murdered how another missionary family died in a plane crash except for the son whose friendship with the yali paves the way for them to turn to christ the book reminded me christ 's words in john verily verily i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit '' on earth stan dale never saw the fruit his life and death brought forth but he will rejoice in heaven with the yali that are there through his witness,1
88,this book is a wonderful rendition which has important factual information on the tallest man the tripling of the population in the past half century and the spectacular olympus mons on the marsian just to mention a few of the many features contained the book is perfect for student projects in science and the arts it well worth the price charged,1
89,the principle question that arises from a reading of soul by soul '' by walter johnson is why was this book written it is touted as history yet not only does it lack any original historical material it also lacks any discernable historical facts rather than history soul by soul '' seems to be a emotional tract designed to promote two fundamental ideas 1. that white people living in the antebellum south were universally loathsome brutish and cruel and 2. that black people living in the antebellum south were universally noble good and abused to support his views professor johnson strings together a loose collection of repetitious snippets from antebellum abolitionist literature and excerpts from gossipy litigation proceedings his personal contribution is represented by his miraculous ability to enter the psyche of the book 's long deceased characters and divine their true but unspoken motives and thoughts quite a feat for any historian ! one loses count of the number of times that the reader is treated to white people using their probing fingers '' in this book fortunately in between probes the reader can be shocked by the killing fields of the lower south '' the historical sexualization of black bodies '' the slaveholders ' inevitable failure to live through the stolen bodies of their slaves '' and the brutish perogatives of whiteness '' this is heavy stuff worthy of a tv but it is out of place in a supposedly serious history text i live in a former slave quarter in new orleans in the antebellum period this building and its resident slaves were interestingly enough owned by a free black who was financially ruined in 1863 by the emancipation proclamation as an amateur historian i would have thought that a book about the new orleans slave market would contain some pertinent historical facts about these markets what were their addresses what percentage of their customers were black what percentage were white how many slaves did the typical new orleans household have how were they fed and clothed what were their working hours these are basic questions that should have been addressed but instead the reader is given an emotionally charged repetitious boring rehash of tired previously published material in short this book for the most part reads like a rambling overly long sermon anyone seeking serious scholarship on the subject of slavery would do well to look elsewhere and should consider reading the slave narratives '' compiled by the federal writers project time on the cross '' by robert fogel and stanley engerman and the slave trade '' by hugh thomas the first of these is a collection of interviews of former slaves performed by the in the 1930 's the latter two works contain original historical research and both deal with the facts of slavery not the emotions,0
90,i want to make a short comment here 1 this book is quite confusing it mixed up the real story with the make up one 2 saying that ramanujun thought goldbach conjecture is wrong was a huge mistake everyone believe that goldbach conjecture is true and ramanujun is a real genius i can not stand this make up part,0
91,the book is entertaining however if you wish to read this from a scholarly point of view and you have spent any time studying the ancient world to any degree you will be appauled to find that the author of this book simply added his own interpretations to events biblical texts and blatantly stretched pun so intended the truth on so much i 'd had enough from a research point of view when this guy not onlt spelt the names of gods wrong but hyped only childish popular perspectives that no closer resemble ancient sumerian belief than does the golden arches as a phallic symbol if you take away any claim of being a historical reference this book is good it 's a tongue and cheek look on the penis and that is about all it does totally not serious but a giggle to be had here and there some of which is at the author 's expense,0
92,sabuda is my favorite maker ! his stuff is so fabulous and intricate it 'll just blow you away,1
93,this book was so different from what i thought it was about when i ordered it it still was knowledgeable it is hard to grasp as you must actually do the experimentation i also thought the illustrations should be in color since that is what the book is about it has some examples in the beginning of the book but i hate to keep looking around in books i personally like it to appear in front of me as i read it was a very interesting book to say the least,1
94,this is not what i expected or wanted the book is written for business senarios with very few suggestions of a personal nature the description of the book does not indicate that it is mainly for business use,0
95,freeman 's justly esteemed lee 's lieutenants '' a three volume work still stands despite the discovery of materials unavailable to freeman when he first wrote in the and as the baseline for any study of the army of northern virginia the cheap attempt by a modern publisher to squeeze a few cents out of the franchise offered here throws out two of every three words freeman wrote to allow for a abridgement '' for those presumably too intimidated by the thought of reading three entire books the work as freeman wrote it was reprinted fairly recently if that is no longer available on amazon any decent sized used book store will have it in stock whatever you do avoid this butchered one volume version like the plague,0
96,kudos to finkelstein for having the courage to tackle such subject matter the fact that he himself a descendent of holocaust survivors has been attacked and derided for writing it just goes to prove one of his underlying points you can not criticize the state of israel or its proponents without being labeled an any discussion of their illegal occupation or the countless un resolutions condemning them is tantamount to sympathizing and promoting terrorism by far one of the most interesting sections is the portion dealing with the swiss banks this version also has an updated appendix that covers rulings left out of the hardcover edition finkelstein does come across overtly hostile at times but his anger is justified and those holding it against him seem to blow it a bit out of proportion very odd that those on the far left and far right both give accolades to this work hilberg 's endorsement carries a tremendous amount of weight and those unfamiliar with his seminal set the destruction of european jews would be well served to check it out,1
97,because you wait and wait and then three do n't turn up at once,0
98,interesting well documented with marvelous a good buy for adults who still dream of fairy tales characters it is a pity that the collection does not include stories from one thousand and one nights '' otherwise it will be perfect and complete,0
99,i was disappointed greatly at the time i opened this book huge gaps between strings lots of empty space on pages all this is for masking the simple fact this 200 pages book '' contents could be easily printed on 80 pages or even less and more these pages are filled with useless interviews '' who wants to read an interview instead of explanations ! and other empty words the book is supposed to teach us how to make modules for nwn 2. but it does n't see the chapter about scripts consists of 4 pages is it really enough for such a great theme these pages i mentioned it already are less than 2 pages this book is better than nothing a bit because some useful information it provides and that 's all good that could be said about it,0
100,this book is the best book on rand 's esthetics i 've ever read in fact it is the only book on the topic that i know of it is refreshing to see that the authors are objective and critical they are not slavish cultists savoring every last word written by rand they approach the material with critical distance and do an excellent job of placing rand 's work in the larger history of esthetic theory they demolish abstract art and devote considerable energy to discussing rand 's definition of art they even propose their own individual alternatives ! if anything shows independence it is this willingness to debate the differences between the authors of the same work ! remarkable ! the world of rand commentary is filled to the brim with sectarianism and partisanship that is clear just by reading one of the reviews here by people who are devotees of certain scholars '' who do nothing but repeat the catechism they take swipes at genuinely independent work anytime it is published that is why they hate this book because it is judge for yourself do n't be fooled,1
101,i found this in the church library but it is not christian fiction it is simply an easy read the story is sweet made even sweeter by the topic cake i am not even much of a cake person i normally prefer ice cream or some sort of etc but as i read i found myself longing for a bit of these intoxicating concoctions put together by the narrator i do n't recommend this book if you are diabetic or on a diet the need for sweets will be simply overpowering,1
102,the reader that keeps with this book will be rewarded the conversations in the book are intelligent the characters and dialogue are real and the descriptions and settings are vivid while the author provides a lengthy disclaimer at the end of the book explaining how the fictional university and town in the book are not based upon yale and new haven it is sometimes hard to believe especially given that the author has been a faculty member at yale law school for over this is not to say however that the descriptions in the book of the law school and town are inaccurate rather they may provide quite an accurate description of a town torn between those affiliated with a prestigious university yale and those that are not in short i enjoyed this book because it kept me guessing and the pace was just right this is not a thriller that grisham might come up with instead this is a much more intellectual read what i enjoyed most about the book are its insights into life itself carter uses fictional characters to explore the good and bad sides to marriage and family life careers law and racism in this country if you are willing to keep reading when the story seems slow and to learn and grow with the characters especially talcott believe me this book will reward you and you 'll be glad you read it,1
103,my something father gave me this book i am a man with a son using my wife 's account i do n't understand for whom this book is written it is full of painfully obvious advice such as do n't play with your food '' or do not throw golf clubs in anger '' anyone raised in america presuming that is the author 's intended audience who does n't already understand these things and take them to heart is n't going to be interested in reading about them in a book if they can even read chapter 15 deals with staring and differences where the author admonishes do not repeat racist sexist or ethnic jokes or tolerate them in your presence '' if you were not a racist you would obviously already understand and agree with this if you are this book is n't going to change your attitude and you would probably want to burn it i found this book useless for any reasonably sophisticated person unless you happen to be from a third world country or another planet if the book was intended to teach good manners to the unsophisticated dream on ! i think the author has a professor henry higgins jones i am also concerned about my father 's opinion of me i mean do not expect a child to endure a lengthy shopping trip unless it is to a toy or candy store '' duh,0
104,this book should be a mandatory read for every parent parent to be what an eye opener ! ! ! this book gives you things to look for in predators how they operate there are comments from real predators as well as victims the book can be difficult to read at times people are truly sick ! but it gives parents power in what to look for how talk to your child ren must read !,1
105,i got this book for my fiance on the recommendation of my rabbi she loves it,1
106,when i thought there were not any more sex techniques '' i could learn from a book this book just amazed with stuff about how to make a lady feel special out of bed this book can make you a better lover husband or sex partner for sure,1
107,dorothy parker was a great writer and a great social observant who now gives us a clear window into the past her wit is biting and at it 's best in this collection favourite reads are for the individual to decide however for me as well as cheering me up with her razor sharp observation and almost cruel wit parker also saddens me for her wit must have been based on the cynacism of one who viewed her life as overindulged and wasted by circumstance as a wealthy woman and as a woman in her time reading her is alawys like laughing with a red hot tear in your eye for her work is as much an insight into her soul as it is to her lifetime and lifestyle,1
108,wells wrote war of the worlds as a warning to the complacent british citizens of his era to not take the status quo for granted the arrogance of some british politicians in particular rubbed wells entirely the wrong way particularly their sentiment that the british had an 'obligation ' to 'civilize ' the world read colonize for its own good well 's book was a rock thrown at that and although he did n't knock it down he made his and in spectacular fashion in one way the martians the conquering british with their superior weapons and baffling ways that must have seemed incomprehensible to the natives of africa and other areas colonized by force wells ' dark tale was also a warning that even the despite their firm belief in their world could be squashed like so many bugs by an indifferent cosmos that did n't give one whit about the british or anyone else 's false boast of superiority in the end though it 's a hopeful just as the martians died off because they were n't biologically suited to live in this world wells also foretells the end of the british empire because the british alien way was not the native way of life in the colonies suggesting that the british would n't survive there long the natives would eventually prevail and they did on top of all that it 's rousing entertainment that can be read just for its drama and suspense and that 's why it 's still in print a hundred years later wakely author of an audience for einstei,1
109,i have always been intrigued with the hells angels and this book answered many questions especially the history of the club i was impressed that the author lived with them for a year,1
110,it 's pretty impressive to think that a book like hiroshima '' was written and appreciated less than a year after the atomic bomb was dropped john hersey took a bold step in investigating the lives and experiences of those who were on the receiving end of the birth of the atomic age interviewing six survivors hersey assembled a snapshot of what it was like have an atomic bomb dropped on your city pure luck and circumstances determine if you survive or not the color of your clothing means everything white clothes reflect the heat while dark clothing absorbs it even if you survive the initial blast what you see next might make you wish you had n't but human beings are stubborn creatures and seem to keep going even in the most hellish circumstances i have been to the hiroshima peace park several times and have seen the human face of the atomic bomb up close and personal it is a humbling experience and one that forever changed my opinions on war as a means of settling disputes hersey 's book has a similar impact being told in such a clinical observational writing style that you ca n't help but be moved by the reality of it all my one criticism of hiroshima '' is the cast of characters that hersey chose to showcase for some reason they seem to be largely christian including a german jesuit priest and a japanese methodist minister with christians being such a tiny percentage of the japanese population considerably less than 1 the choice to interview japanese christians seems a deliberate one hersey is telling the us readers see they are n't heathen devils they are christians just like you and me that 's who we dropped the bomb on that 's who we killed '' this puts in question the journalistic neutrality of the book and has hersey in the light of putting across an agenda instead of simpling reporting what was,1
111,when i reviewed the street lawyer recently i mentioned that i 've never put down a grisham unfinished and that we should throw the man some props for that book certainly for this one nope i read four chapters 41 of its 391 pages and gave up totally unengaged and uncaring about any of his characters or his plot i hope he just had an off day or something and that what he wrote later got back to what makes him so readable,0
112,this was one of five books that i brought from and by far the worst of the lot this man has one idea about how the government really works take it from me i have been with the irs for five years,0
113,sheer and utter this hardly can be called a work of fiction had this been his first work i could understand the grammatical mistakes but this is inexcuseable the publisher should be fined for this book and the editor fired,0

120,the notion of interpretive communities '' is at best derivative of kuhn 's classical work the structure of scientific revolutions and at worst a framework of obstruction employed against those who wish to revivify literary theory and criticism in the wake of postmodern hegemony,0
121,i know a lot of people liked this book but it did n't work for me the main character and his buddies run around like chickens with their heads cut off acting as if they have committed a huge crime the problem is they did n't there is no crime i talked to several cops and a prominent defense attorney about this plot and it makes no sense it would make sense if someone comes after the mcguffin early on but no one does not until very late in the book so most of the story has no foundation,0
122,ageless body is deepak 's attempt to neutralize the word old '' as in old age the writer has a knack for making common words like body mind '' and self '' into profound concepts his technique is to overlay his abstract ideas with suggestive experimental studies but ambiguity in interpreting these studies abound if you like poetry deepak may be your read the billions of changes occurring in our cells are only the passing scenery of life 36 '' or try to interpret this one the emptiness at the core of every atom is the womb of the universe in the flicker of thought when two neurons interact there is an opportunity for a new world to be born '' at times he attributes to cells and dna a creative intelligence to direct their own construction and at other times his designer is invisible he would make a great spokesman for the current hocus pocus over intelligent design '' he ca n't accept the growth of any cell even a plant cell without an intelligence involved he mentions and attacks evolution only one time on 115 asserting that the growth of a cell could never be a random process deepak ends up in the very same thought circle as every other writer who tries to explain life in scientific terms intelligence is a self organizing entity and every cell evolved is only intelligence having a conversation with itself whether your word game tosses in the word quantum '' or not does n't change much what a solipsistic thought what a solipsistic world i wonder if his readers who actually experienced the oneness deepak speaks of would n't after awhile go insane,0
123,os guinness has a knack for taking difficult and complex subjects and capturing and presenting information that allows small chunks of the philosophy to be grasped and pondered deeply this book is no exception the fact that it is also a study guide is even more effective in delivering the message while directing the reader to several key questions to consider in each section one of the best aspects of the book are the hundreds of quotes and essays all around the central theme of the importance of character while our culture often acts to create an end justifies the means '' behavioral set never before has character been so important or so difficult to really practice and live the book begins with some essays from famous leaders from plato to george washington winston churchill to machiavelli and compares and contrasts what each felt about the importance of character and how it was to be demonstrated much of the material is pretty well known yet the ability to so easily read and discuss different styles and approaches is well worth the effort my favorite sections were on the cultural erosions of character '' in which the many examples of how society pushes and changes the definition and meaning in life impacts what we define as important at all from advertising to media the pressure to conform is greater than ever but in some ways has always existed one of the best essay 's in my opinion is called the revenge of failure '' wherein henry fairlie rips the legend of our times '' as envy at its worst no longer content to envy what others have and we do not we now attempt to destroy in others that which we can not achieve ourselves this process degrades talent and is a poor attempt to buy '' our way into importance not through the achievement of something remarkable but through the tearing down of the remarkable achievement into something attainable thus character becomes something that is no longer earned '' the sections on plastic surgery and other shifts into a looks based culture further erode the importance of character in this relentless and obsessed pursuit of the elusive perfection the hunter becomes the hunted and always loses in the battle to fight against aging and the myth of happiness in ones physical appearance powerful depictions of how this societal pressure has claimed far too many who sacrifice character for fleeting and shallow appearance are depicted with a convicting clarity overall this is a very well done and thought provoking book as a study guide it would be ideal for small groups or even personal reflections the book is so full of quotes and essays that it can be read at once or in dozens of small bites with equal effectiveness highly recommended,1
124,through forster 's impressive command of the english language and advanced character development the story of helen margaret schlegel unfolds the sisters who are highly educated pensive and artistic become entangled with the wilcox family practical unilateral capitalists and the basts working class and unassuming however the initially subtle differences between the sisters and how they approach love misfortune and personal relations become more obvious as the novel progresses climaxing in a scandalous ending that was unexpected from a english novel i think some of the 1 and 2 start reviewers never actually read the novel to its dramatic end human nature notwithstanding the novel 's refinement gorgeous writing and riveting prevail to the end i loved it !,1
125,this book is almost useless for helping someone understand how to use acupressure to alleviate physical symptoms as a licensed massage therapist who already knows quite a bit about acupressure i am always willing to learn more about any kind of bodywork i had hoped to be able to pass on some ideas to my clients for self help but this book was definitely not it the book gives some accupoints for specific problems some of these are golden points '' able to stand alone in use but others are not the book gives no order to use these in and furthermore does not specify if all or any of the points are to be used together in sequence or not also it does't tell where the points are exactly there are really too many flaws to go into here acupressure is very complex this book tries to simplify it to the point that it looks like some goofy folklore advocating some bad mojo,0

129,in response to the guy who said this book is n't scientific '' i say it 's as scientific as the diagnosis which is essentially a catalog of behaviors that annoy teachers but i digress there 's no scientific proof that adhd actually exists as a disorder since we do n't understand the brain or why it does things how can we assume that brain scans actually tell anyone anything choosing a positive perspective about annoying behavior is a good start the book is worth your time but you should also check out hallowell or ingersoll,1
130,white wolf wanted to revitalize a mature product line by rewriting it and they had problems with the old system that deserved fixing they did an excellent job on the core rules and the game mechanics are overall the best they 've ever been one of the flaws of mage ascension was that it is dominated by the struggle between the technocracy and the traditions in a manner that reflected vampire masquerade 's clan structure and sabbat vs camarilla one of the flaws of vampire masquerade was that it had this whole history of caine as the first vampire and the as the founders of the clans '' that overshadowed the game in mage ascension mages saw themselves as having evolved over time and that history had been by the technocracy so who really knew about the past in awakening they took exactly what they were trying to jettison from vampire and put it into mage with the creation of atlantis and the exarchs the societies that replace the traditions are not as interesting the replacement of avatars with towers does n't make sense to me the eternal struggle theme remains with the exarchs but seems a lot less important than the struggle over the consensus in ascension awakening is chock full or rotes for mage in a larp rotes are essential shifting emphasis to rotes improves the compatibility of table top and live action systems but detracts from the table top experience where mages can do almost anything they split the entropy sphere into death and fate which kind of makes sense except that death has too much overlap with spirit i 'm going to use the new mechanics with the old world in my new campaign the new mage setting does n't inspire me like the old one did while the new vampire and werewolf settings may catch on i think the new mage is going to be a flop after the core book i do n't expect to purchase any more of the supplements,0
131,to say christianity will die is to say that one can see the end of the world purely craziness christianity will live as long as the world exists what is died is the faith for many christians what has been changed is our faith by money pride and selfishness and consequently our church and our societies what dominants many us and european christian churches is a worldly christianity a christianity affected by the materialism and the exact thing that jesus repeatedly condamned i feel extremely sad when i can see pasters and evangelists earn salaries live in luxury houses in business class or socialize with social elite i feel extremely sad when i see young theology students without experience and spiritual life become pasters and preasts jesus have given us great mission to preach gospel to every corner in the world but money pride and selfishness have consumed the hearts and sole of many christians and today they love the world more than they love jesus are they still christians of course not to say christianity needs change is purely nonesense only person see himself greater than jesus would say something like that what needs to be changed is ourselves not christianity because we have embaked a wrong way following the world and not following jesus,0
132,i first saw this book reviewed in the early 1990 's it aroused a double response of curiosity and suspicion like many a cynic i asked myself now who 's this guy and what 's he spinning '' against my natural inclination to dismiss it i ordered pog on receiving it i began reading and found my suspicions confirmed here was another triumphal and insensitive adherent to the doctrine of the sovereignty of god strangely however i could n't stop reading despite months of scrawling angry in the margins of its pages i was drawn inexplicably to the sensibility of its core premise about god 's delight in being god to make this story short i found myself in the end exhausted but surrendered to the portrait of god that piper paints with the full palette of scriptural truth and finally happy too with the beginnings of the joy piper wished for his sons in the foreword salvation history testifies to the fact that a distinguishing evidence of the truth is that it is often hated at first the fact that pog eventually had such an unnatural or supernatural effect on someone like me initially so inclined to resist and rebuff speaks more to the validity of this book than if i had joined immediately in the chorus of deserved admiration this is not a critical analysis of pog others have provided that sufficiently on this page instead it 's a personal account of the irresistible grace that against all nature drew a small and scoffing soul into undeserved open spaces where god 's glory was seen and is now sung,1
133,i could n't help myself when i opened the juicing bible i should have been doing other things but i spent over an hour perusing the pages it contains a wealth of information on fruits herbs and vegetables and their healing properties the layout is handy and it is easy to find things with the detailed indices the recipes are simple clearly written and sound delicious i am excited and inspired in fact i 'm going to get my juicer off of the bottom shelf of the pantry and go for it,1

135,i bought this book this weekend as we 're doing the in a row preschooler and i do n't much like it i 've got a mother personality disorder and who does n't observe personal boundaries of other 's if i need a break away she hunts down my poor husband all my relatives and ugh and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as i could see her reading this to me and justifying her 'stalker mom ' mentality in the end i think if a person is from a household respect for a child 's boundaries and need for space away from their parents then this book is okay i just find some moms are too even ones personality and this book does n't send a message about love as much as 'i own you ' i like 'mama do you love me ' better for explaining to a child a parent 's unconditional love moon ' by margaret wise brown however is by far my children 's all time favorite book i was reading that one to them ineutero and still every night before they go to bed they love it and so do we as parents but this one even creeped my hubby out and he 's from a fairly 'normal ' family take it grain of salt,0
136,i agree with one of the earlier reviewers headlines that was something like just ok not great '' i 've been working server 2003 for a while now and from my work experience i knew certain things in the book were kind of being glossed over that really needed more coverage i would read each chapter read the summaries take all the practice questions and be left with this nagging feeling that the book was not really preparing me completely for what i 'd face on the exam unfortunately i was right and i just missed passing the exam this book is n't terrible but just be sure you use some additional resources and that you have some good work experience also,0
137,mailer tells us a lot we do n't want to know about it 's the gloomy long tale of an egocentric writer 's acceptance of the ups and downs of his metier he gives his biased opinions on things he knows and things he does n't know about all the negative aspects of his persona are laid out still it must have taken some bravery to lay out some of them or else he needed the money truth sells even if it is a very mediocre unfocused book and quite it should have been titled me and my books some thoughts on me and my writing '',0
138,this was a terrible disappointment more of a memoir than anything about it was so disjointed it is hard to say what it was about or what the point was there seemed to be no context or fabric to the book there were however hundreds of references to obscure authors actors magazines and books there were pages at a time where i was completely lost because i had no idea about whom the author was speaking but he wrote as if the person was to the reader baxter leads the reader around the world from his beginnings in australia thence to britain to the us and ending in france again there is no context he would flip from a reference to the obscure artist to an anecdote about himself or some bookseller or collector and then perhaps mention how he had acquired a book if viewed as a book about collecting books you will not learn much if viewed as a memoir there was little that was interesting about the author 's life and there was precious little about his life other than acquisitions there were a very few nuggets about what makes a book valuable or diminishes its worth to a collector but they were too few and far between if you could not tell by now i can not see much reason to read this book i think baxter flattered himself to think that either he or his collection would be of general interest,0
139,does know any other law schools besides harvard and yale for her characters to have attended i am so tired of her books this is it for me its the usual suspects for her rich and white boring i used to love her and would read anything from her but those days are over she should retire,0
140,this is a revolutionary book it introduces the stage metaphor into sociology all of social interaction is a performance on a stage it 's questionable how novel this metaphor is but this is certianly its first explicit statement the language used to present the ideas of the author is like most sociological writing unecessarily complicated there are some problems with clarity and structure the book just doesnt have a holistic feel for me no sociological background is presupposed there is extensive quoting from other sociological sources many footnotes and various other ways to enter sociological literature throught the book so if you are interested in reading sociology this is probably a good place to start again the language is unecessicarily thick and this may be it 's bane as an introduction however the book is misguided the idea of viewing social interaction as a performance on a stage is unecessary the authors motives for saying this will make my position clearer the following is a charicature of the author 's argument there is certianly a large amount of social behavior which is directed towards other people the audience in order for the audience to build an impression of the actor well if it can happen here we can draw a parallel with other situations infact all situations and therfore all of social interaction is like a performance on a stage all the world is not of course a stage but the crucial ways in which it isnt are hard to specify '' p 72 the performances can either be with individuals or groups of people and they can be performing conciously or unconciously end of charicature there are other arguments obviously and the statement we can draw a parallel with other situations '' is most of the content of the book which i dont like to gloss over with a sentence but the real question here is is the view worthwhile my answer no social interaction is a complex phenomena that cant possibly be summed up with a signle metaphor yes some social interaction is like a performance where indivudals are intentionally making impressions on one another yes some social behavior can arise from unconcious beliefs however most social interaction is exactly the way we see it conciously controlled meaningful purposeful interaction with individuals it is not some kind of performance with the purpose of creating a reality '' i hope my view of the book is clear so that the biases on the final part of my review can be sorted out the book is a waste of time where the author is right the statement is little more than common sense where the author goes outside of common sense he 's wrong sometimes plainly so this book is part of the tradition in sociology of thinking that society pulls the wool over each individuals eyes that reality is a social construct with no purpose other than social control here the wool is the performance and the control has to do with impressions but this quickly degenerates into an obscure mess of assertions there is no real empirical support given for most of the claims where evidence '' is given the evididence is so heavily intepreted that it fails to correspond to facts in the world but rather to facts about the views of the reporter where there is no correspondence to the world there is no truth various sources of sociology are cited but this is more like intellectual bullying saying that some author which also didnt have any empirical support for his claims agrees with you is just to bully your reader into acepting your claims the claims in the book have no practical application in the world but only serve to intepret situations differently and in personal opinion less correctly nothing said here will lead to better predictions about social behavior or a better understanding of psychology in short this isnt a scientific study at all my final qualm with the book deserves its own paragraph the use of language the best example is the definitions given at the end of the introduction a performance may be defined as all of the activity of a given participant on a given occasion which serves to influence in any way any of the other participants '' 15 this is a curios definition me breathing while i work is a performance it changes the percentages of and in the atmosphere near my me staring into space is a performance other people see me stare into space and are therefore influenced infact me simply existing is a performance since my existance causes a gravitational effect on the other participants as well as influencing them to create beliefs about me existing its as if goffman created a definition for performance which included all possible actions taken by any person and then wrote a book about how all possible actions taken by any person fall under the category of performance he didnt he used a word that we associate with controlled behavior performance and defined it in a way no one is used to then he used alot of word play to show that behavior has no substance its all for the purpose of maintaining social reality i hope this very limited example shows the terrible use of language that is endemic to goffman and sociology more generally so an ode to sociology is in order actually no it isnt why wont this subject go away this book is an integral part of sociology and it espouses the methods and style of sociological researchers and writers by being an archetypical work within the tradition the methods are questionable the style is obscure like it or hate it sociology is a part of modern thought read the book to be an educated person and keep in mind its intellectual failings,0
141,greg treverton has written a much needed overview of the national intelligence process and correctly identified the challenges which face the us in a world his views of the world beyond 2010 are quite revealing and his challenges to the intelligence community to assess threats to the us are precisely focused his views on the major intelligence entities reveal urgent modifications of structure and process if the intelligence community is going to regain relevance with national customers as a teacher of intelligence process specifically as it relates to strategic warning i believe this book is essential reading for anyone who aspires to be a true intelligence professional this book will help even the wisest analyst understand how to maximize available sources and methods the quest to provide the best possible intelligence is a goal which must be achieved,1
142,i ca n't remember the last time i failed to finish reading a novel i abandoned this one with 100 pages to go with another implausible plot twist i 've had enough maybe i 've been spoiled by the quality of character driven fiction from george pelecanos james lee burke robert b parker james sallis scott phillips and robert crais but i suspect that this is not just a failure to connect with the characters and more to do with poor writing i 've read quite a number of deaver 's novels and enjoyed the complex plots and the exploration of devient chbaracters but this is just over the top when i came to the chapter that excplained how the magician faked his death while in custody that was enough i have another fifty novels lined up waiting to be read and i 'll be damned if i 'm going to waste any more time on this poor one for that matter after six or so lincoln rhyme novels i ca n't say that i really know or care anything about lincoln or saches,0
143,this is an excellent book on the role of the state after a revolution how it will wither away and what a society should look like or try to mould itself into after the revolution lenin drawing on the works of marx and engels extensively refutes many claims by both the anarchists and opportunists on the role of the state and corrects many common errors believed about the marxist road to socialism this is a thoroughly informative read i recommend those wondering how a communist society would emerge after a revolution to get this book it will open your eyes widely,1
144,i have received your new book against the human race and thank you for it never was such cleverness used in the design of making us all stupid one longs in reading your book to walk on all fours but as i have lost that habit for more than sixty years i feel unhappily the impossibility of resuming it nor can i embark in search of the savages of canada because the maladies to which i am condemned render a european surgeon necessary to me because war is going on in those regions and because the example of our actions has made the savages nearly as bad as ourselves '' voltaire 1755,0

147,the title grabbed me because i have been noticing for oh about 14 years now the decline of the truth in this country unfortunately this book is written precisely by the kind of person who has lost touch with reality and what truth is definition of irony i believe the reason it is 1 on the bestseller list is because there is a ready audience out there of similarly detached people who want anything and i mean anything a website with a good conspiracy story and a glass of warm milk before bed everynight is their ideal that backs up their point of view it is precisely why the truth is so out of fashion new media streams like the internet blogs etc offer up news '' without accountability they allow this segment of society to avoid confronting the truth and instead construct their own alternative realities it makes people like frank rich rich with very little effort why bother checking facts his core readership does n't care whether it is true or not just tell them bush is evil,0

152,i started the book last night and could n't put it down until 4 am but at least i finished it ! it was a good storyline i enjoyed getting a simple glimpse into the media world it also gives you a good peek into the corruption behind campaigns and politics in general i really liked the characters in this book although each one in my opinion could have used some more depth the only reason this book does n't get 5 stars is because as you read it you start to feel that the second half of the book with extra emphasis on the last quarter of the book was completely rushed i really do n't like a sudden closing to a book however it really does keep you guessing until the last couple of pages i just feel that it could have had more of an impact and more of that umph '' had the story been written at the same speed throughout i do recommend this book for anyone who just wants a good book to read if you 're looking for something you will remember for life this is n't going to be it but if you 're looking for a pleasant way to spend a nice afternoon by all means try reading mary jane clark 's do you etc '' final word i believe her the other clark would be quite proud of her in law the woman can write however given her talents i wish she would learn to write in her own style instead of in the familiar style of the other clark,1
153,the kite runner gets off to such a good start with its blend of history observations about daily life in kaboul and a compelling story of two boys growing up together the second half goes badly astray as the novel becomes more and more manipulative and sentimental by the end of the book the author is willing to put his characters through all sorts of hell just so he can follow up with a teary reconciliation i wish an editor had convinced him to tighten it up stay focused and resist the urge to tug at the heartstrings with such a heavy hand,0
154,is this a book of new yorker cartoons or a puzzle book well it 's a little of both and the result is a novel way to laugh and exercise your brain at the same time most of the 83 puzzles consist of cartoons that are missing words captions or picture components by figuring out the missing elements and sometimes combining them with acrostics crossword puzzles or other word grids the cartoon humor is revealed for the most part the puzzles are of only moderate difficulty although there are a few difficult ones at least for me that involve matching a cartoon with the decade in which it was created or matching cartoons from early and late in a cartoonist 's career frequent puzzle solvers will recognize many of the familiar puzzle types from games magazine and other media that puzzability publishes in the foreword to the book contains a casual and loosely coupled conversation between new yorker cartoon editor robert mankoff and new york times puzzle editor will shortz this is an entertaining book that you 'll hate to throw away when it 's been completed because of all the witty cartoons it contains enjoy ! eileen riebac,1
155,in his book trading risk ken grant draws upon his experience as a risk manager for tudor investments and sac capital to create an insightful and surprisingly guide for traders and portfolio managers as director of trader development at a large proprietary trading house i have been impressed with the role risk management plays in the success of the firm and its individual traders moreover this is a scalable difference risk management very much impacts the outcomes of individual trades results of trading days and performance across entire quarters where i believe grant has admirably succeeded is in documenting that risk management is much more than simply cutting your losses '' trading risk systematically breaks down elements of the process of managing trades from the establishment of concrete objectives to the allocation of risk capital to specific trades and the use of correlation analysis in evaluating trading results his discussions of adjusting portfolio exposure and evaluating the risk components of individual trades are highly practical and encourage a rigor of that is rarely practiced perhaps an example from my own work with traders that overlaps grant 's ideas might be illustrative i encourage traders to keep a log of all their trades that tracks time of day position taken position size holding period and changes to the position are also documented as traders scale into or out of trades from this record we can evaluate a host of performance statistics such as position sizing as a function of market the correlation of profitability with trade period and patterns of activity within the trading day while grant 's background is with portfolio to a manager who is holding a basket of positions in a variety of ideas are easily adaptable to the intraday trader who is trading a single instrument by viewing each trade during a day as an element of that day 's portfolio '' we can ask important questions about the mix of position sizes overall directional bias and the management of volatility as a function of trade limits written in an engaging style with bits of humor interspersed trading risk ends with a practical chapter that summarizes the book 's major points he explains the importance of developing and modifying trading plans defining one 's trading edge '' judiciously allocating risk capital and improving performance at the margin '' this latter point is a particularly neglected element in risk management for the active large trader the ability to squeeze the extra tick out of trades is frequently the difference between a winning day and a losing one superior traders have an ability to read the very patterns of price change and momentum to determine when it is prudent to hit the bid or let the market go offer in exiting a position at such points good risk management and good trading are indistinguishable i have few reservations about grant 's book a text of 250 pages is not going to provide many examples something that would help the more mathematically challenged master the ideas of and correlation analysis small retail traders who trade only occasionally will probably find the risk metrics less compelling than larger active traders or portfolio managers though the basic principles emphasized in the last chapter certainly apply to any serious trader considering the absence of serious discussions of risk management in the popular trading literature trading risk is a major contribution and a worthy addition to a library i plan to use it as a core reading in our training program for new traders perhaps the best endorsement i can give,1
156,imaginary playmates are not unusual but there has n't been a playmate like tillytilly since those nasties henry james created in turn of the screw '' and like them tillytilly seems to be something more than what a child has imagined jessamy harrison the daughter of a nigerian mother and a british father is a precocious and lonely child subject to screaming tantrums and panic attacks during a visit to her nigerian relatives jess explores an abandoned building and meets tillytilly a child of her own age who she befriends the problem is no one else can see tillytilly on their return to england tillytilly mysteriously shows up and soon leads jess into a heap of trouble fun becomes horror as tilly demonstrates a penchant for cruelty given that miss oyeyemi was only 18 when she penned this complex novel there are some drawbacks jess is often portrayed as much more sophisticated and articulate than the reader can believe and some characters are not drawn out enough despite these flaws maturity is certain to give us a writer well worth watching for in the future,1

159,the beginning of this book was excellent but dont be fooled the first few chapters are the only decent part of this book the rest of the book is just filled with sex and the ultimate downfall is that there is no foreshadowing to the killers what 's the point of writing it if the reader cant try to figure out who the murderers were this was one of the worst books i have ever read i 'd call it a trashy romance novel with a hint of mystery dont waste your time reading it,0
160,i had to read this book as an assignment for a seminary class on leadership i was sceptical that a children 's book about witches would be applicable to a master 's level college course my scepticism was unfounded this is a good fun read but more than that this is a story that tugs at heart strings and teaches through the trials and personalities of it 's characters i recommend it to children '' of all ages !,1
161,suzanne brockmann is an unbelievable writer and her stories always draw me in the mystery '' portion of the story and the romance between jane and cosmo left a little to be desired i really did n't understand why jane had to have her alternative personality as mercedes and cosmo was a little to soft for keeping up the hardened seal persona these particular characters seemed a bit empty compared to jules and robin who clearly stole the show in this book as a matter of fact of the different plots and stories going on in this book jules ' was the best it was not only very and sweet but even as a hetrosexual female i could identify with jules and how he felt at times because what was happening to him happens to all of us whether you are in a gay or straight relationship i am really hoping that jules either gets his own book or has more appearances in future novels where he does find true happiness i do share brockmann 's opinion when it comes to differences in appearance nationality sexual orientation etc and i really like how she includes this in her books as far as i 'm concerned love is love no matter what and it 's portrayed beautifully here please brockmann do n't allow the naysayers to steer you away from this storyline it 's a very good one,1

163,this has to be one of the most ridiculous books i have ever read at one point the authors ask if money equals security would n't you feel safe walking through a major american city at midnight with a suitcase full of cash handcuffed to your wrist if money really did equal security you would ! i stopped reading after that i will say however that this book cured me of all of my bad financial habits i never want to be so bad off as to look to a book like this for advice again,0
164,first off i have not read this book myself so disreguard this review if you want i 'm reviewing it because based on the reviews and what i can tell here and from descriptions from my own mother i believe this is the book she used in a failed attempt to me i am 99 sure but she does not remember the title so i ca n't be 100 sure my mother described a system where she devoted one day to nothing but she got everyone else out of the house and removed all my toys from eyesight then she went through a detailed explanation using a potty doll and had me try to explain it back using the doll she then showed me what looked like a whole kitchen full of little toys and candy and told me i would get rewarded for using the potty that day i remember all that part after that she said that we went through a process where she had to scold me for accidents and we did nothing but try to go potty all day i was definately old enough to be doing this because i actually remember it i am 25 now so if this book was published in the late or early i 'm being accurate now let me tell you the results i do n't remember how i felt that day but i do know that it started something that became a huge emotional battle for me i was a very sensitive child and i am a very sensitive adult what mom and i remember was that became a war in our and it took years because of my sensitivities and my mother 's poor choice in training methods i began holding my bowel movements i was able urinate in the potty at a normal age not sure when i would hold bowel movements whenever i had the urge to go even if she put me back in a diaper i held for weeks at times and sometimes this required a lot of pain for me obviously when it finally got to the point that i could n't hold it anymore the bm was so big that i needed physical help to go sometimes it would get so bad that the opposite result would i 'd have a sudden diarheaa because the muscles were fatigued this went on for years and the doctors kept telling mom that i 'd eventually outgrow it she tried suppositories oil fiber and even started giving me adult doses of laxatives finally when i was 5 two years into this mom made a tape recording of me screaming while trying to go to the bathroom a doctor took pity on us and prescribed enemas i used them on and off for two more years i was finally fully potty at seven i am now 25 and occasionally i still notice some health problems that may be attributable to this now obviously there is no way i can fully explain why all that happened and i certainly can not blame all of that on the book i was a very sensitive kid and my mom picked a bad time to do it too i had just had a baby brother but i just want to describe the danger of using a insensitive method and i 'm not just talking about the pain i went through if we 're to believe freudian theories about the anal stage of well let 's just say i could be his poster child i am now my own highly sensitive daughter who will be 3 in a week we have been working on this no specific methods just lots of sitting on the potty for over a year now and with no results but i 'm not in a hurry and thats because she 's not ready and we need to do this on her timetable not mine,0
165,i 'm perhaps the only steinbeck lover not to have yet read grapes of wrath '' or east of eden '' instead i have focused on of mice and men '' and his lesser known works such as to a god unknown '' and my personal favorite pastures of heaven '' i 've been enamored with his ability to vividly craft characters in particular when i began reading in dubious battle '' it appeared the most engaging of all steinbeck 's work telling the story of american communist party workers jim and mac it begins with the story of hardscrabble jim initiating himself into mac 's radical cell there is a great and misleading sense of intrigue mac and jim travel by boxcar work secretly through letters go from secret contact to contact and finally arrive among disgruntled orchard workers early on the pace is fast exciting and engaging suddenly steinbeck simply fails to deliver leaving the reader wondering when he 's going to pick up the pace again after jim and mac slowly initiate a worker 's strike i expected the sense of excitement to continue it simply never does summary of in dubious battle '' workers get mad workers get tired workers get mad workers get tired workers get mad workers get tired the rest of the book mostly concerns jim and mac talking and talking and talking and talking and while their philosophical chats are mildly interesting at first they simply repeat themselves for the rest of the book most of the action takes place in the dark or far away from the narration and most of the story simply concerns the strikers bickering over petty nonsense and eating steinbeck must have been peckish while writing this story because at least a good 25 of the story concerns finding eating and worst of all talking about food there is plenty of action that steinbeck could have shown during the story but for some reason he prefers to focus on jim and mac endlessly walking from tent to tent in their encampment discussing whatever comes to mind steinbeck 's sense of intrigue and social injustice is worth reading the first few chapters but i advise any reader of in dubious battle '' to take this course after the strike is initiated simply set the book down you wo n't miss anything nothing of great import happens and only a very few memorable characters ever surface and they are lost among the sea of forgettable faces i suppose now i 'll give grapes of wrath '' a go perhaps if it is n't one of his greats '' it is n't worth reading,0
166,the books how to win friends and influence people and talking the winner 's way are both way superior to this short book most of what you read is basically review if you 've ready other similar books and what 's present does n't pack enough substance or how to '' to make it really worth your time about through the book gabor started presenting fresh ideas the problem however is that it was through the book not a bad read but there 's so much better if you happen across it one day on the street it wo n't do any harm to read it but i ca n't recommend paying money for something you already know or can get for a better deal,0
167,who published these weak translations yup they are on newsprint and get smudged immediately how about using real paper b n needs to stop thinking opportunistically and start thinking about quality,0
168,i am so passionate about this book it has answered all the life questions i have ever held although many people i have recommended it to have reported that they have not been able to get into it '' for me i would say it is the best book i have ever read this is about the copy i have purchased because when i lend it out somehow it is not returned and i want to have a copy to every now and then i will not be lending this one again,1
169,before purchasing made in detroit i read the reader reviews the reviews were so mixed that i decided against buying the book and checked it out of the library instead as it turns out i made the best decision all i can say is you fellow reviewers ' this book was definitely not worth the purchase price my statement has nothing to do with the author 's writing skills he is a skilled writer it has everything to do with his lack of insight that paul clemens could live in a city and have such a skewed view of it is downright scary i read the book waiting for paul to have a revelation that would help him put the pieces of his life together and make peace with them but after 241 pages he was no more enlightened than he was on page one blacks are caricatures whose sole role in life is to make paul 's life hard women are peripheral characters who are barely given a voice he finds a way to put down and demean everyone who is not a white male in his book if you are a white male who harbors secret racist feelings you will enjoy this book and it will validate your feelings if you are anyone else your reaction will no doubt range from mild boredom to outrage as i read this book i felt sadness a profound sense of dismay and had some of my worse fears confirmed there are white folks who actually still think like this my hope is that the light comes on for paul he is still young if it does maybe he will share his insights with us,0
170,this is the worst most depressing piece of fiction i have ever read there is no real protoganist and not one singular character worthy of admiration and after a while their actions just become inexplicable the author 's soul must truly be an ugly one to have devoted so much time and energy to using his mind to generate so many casual acts of evil throughout the book it starts out promising but by the time you get to about halfway through the book or so you get a nagging sense that your very own soul might be sucked out of you and permanently stolen by the heart of neil gaiman 's darkness or one of his minions additionally the characters ' motivations change like the shifting sands nothing they do makes any real sense except some inexplicable movement towards doing greater and more evil en masse like some sort of coagulating bacteria or disease what is so creepy about this book is the casualness of it all unlike some of stephen king 's work ie the stand there is absolutely no redeeming thread here no rallying or marshalling the troops to combat the emerging evil it 's evil in evil evil surrounded by evil all i can say is that this book is ugly ugly ugly at least writers like joyce carol oats and joseph conrad 's intentions when writing about such things is to effectively demonstrate the ill effects of such darkness but to make heroes of characters one should avoid is unconscionable the choices the supposed protoganist makes make no sense and you do root for him in the very beginning but you find he is just like one of them after all i suspended my doubt and disbelief as long as i could but finally became so incensed by the audacity of both the literary critics and the author to pass this off as excellence i literally stopped and chose to never read this author 's work again it 's a shame too because he has allied himself in other incarnations with a truly gifted artist dave mckean who maybe has n't completely gone over to the dark side like neil has his association with dave mckean is the only reason i even the book and maybe a little because the title intrigued me but it 's unfortunate that the industry rewards clever '' works such as gaiman 's with undue praise i 've never so strongly disliked a book have you ever found yourself getting angry because you felt robbed or duped by a book well do n't believe the hype this is the one to throw in the trash or disintegrate with eyeball laserbeams before all your humanity is sucked out of you,0
171,in her latest book tracey wood demystifies the process of teaching kids to read as parents we 've all been told that reading is critical to a child 's success in school in a future career and for pleasure and enrichment throughout a lifetime we feel a great deal of pressure to help our children achieve this important skill but typically do n't know how to go about it tracey presents a refreshingly straightforward approach to teaching reading skills the book is of word lists fun activities games and creative ideas to engage a child 's interest and get him reading there are helpful book recommendations for readers of all levels including parents ! and pointers on spotting reading problems early with practical suggestions for getting help the book is spiced with humorous anecdotes parents can truly appreciate tracey 's compassion and commonsense shine through and take the stress out of teaching kids to read i highly recommend this book to parents of beginning readers,1
172,it 's no wonder that people look at me strangely when i explain a great love of history to them it 's books like this that persist in the ruination of history for many a student if this book were more widely circulated the need for sleeping pills would be drastically reduced i have no idea how the author could take something this interesting and make it so boring that i would literally fall asleep reading it,0
173,i 'm a long time fan of the anna pigeon mysteries and have read all the others unfortunately hard truth '' does not live up to the quality of barr 's earlier works it feels very contrived it also appears to take advantage of stereotypes against religious groups this book just does not meet the expectations i 've come to expect from the series,0
174,not only a terrific portrait of louis mayer but a wonderful history of hollywood my caveat is the portrait of dore schary while eyman is fair in his depiction of the struggle between mayer and thalberg eyman found it necessary to choose sides in the mayer schary conflict in the last part of the book possibly to correct '' the view of mayer the monster and schary the savior in earlier mayer bios his portrait of schary a man i knew bears no resemblance to that decent fair minded and gifted man it is clear that he interviewed few surviving friends and family members of schary eyman claims that schary had no knowledge of the making of musicals yet schary in his post mgm days produced a successful musical the unsinkable molly brown '' whatever good flims came from mgm during schary 's reign are dismissed as the work of others he creates a portrait of schary as a talentless hack forgetting not only the good films schary wrote in earlier days but the successful broadway play he wrote about fdr sunrise at campabello '' he writes that schary only spoke of himself in retirement i knew few older men who took such an interst in world affairs and the fortunes and misfortunes of his friends if he can get schary so wrong it forces me to question his other judgments having said all that i think this is a fine book evoking old hollywood with grace and style,1
175,you have to ask yourself why did william grimes think there was the need for another culinary dictionary '' as you read the book the answer comes quickly before you 're even very far into the a 's '' apparently he did n't i was repeatedly disappointed by the cursory often puerile definitions which accompany most of the 2000 culinary terms grimes presents the simplistic line or two of text each are accompanied by are often incomplete and sometimes down right misleading the introduction builds up the book as a necessary tool to help we little folk through the growing complexities of modern food buying and eating in a world no longer dominated by a few french terms we are led to believe that this book will bridge the gap between cooking books say from before 1990 and the current state of culinaria why then are so many of the terms defined in an even archaic take the term brown sugar '' this book says it is unrefined or partially refined sugar '' a definition all well and good perhaps 200 years ago today brown sugar is almost always made from refined sugar with a special molasses syrup and colorings added back to it a very different thing indeed and grimes should know the difference the are innumerable other examples available in the same vein additionally grimes give us food lists '' scattered periodically throughout the book but provides only sporadic support for the words used in them for example there is a list of varieties of apples 48 varieties are listed but when one wants more information on them it is often lacking sure red delicious '' apples have an insipid definition in the r '' section but what about the more interesting varieties like sundowner '' or lodi '' apples no further mention of them can be found in the book there is also a huge list of fish and seafood '' but if you are intrigued by what the geoduck '' or sprat '' listed might be you 're out of luck without running to a real culinary dictionary the bright if limited spots in the book are the articles on food etymology and history there are 7 of them reprints from other publications and various authors that are each informative and interesting grimes would have done much better to have put together a collection of these little insightful gems and left the definitions to those more inspired by the subject my guess is that the brevity of the definitions leading to rampant deficiencies was perhaps an attempt at simplicity but the effective '' of the book is insulting to anything but the most elementary reader i know that grimes a former restaurant reviewer for the new york times must know a lot more about food than this book makes him sound grimes is listed as the editor '' of this work along with a number of others and it defies logic why he would allow his name used as the primary unfortunately my copy of this book is destined for '' or a permanent place on a dusty shelf somewhere while my venerable larousse gastronomic retains it 's place of honor near my desk bon appetite ex libris and caveat emptor dh,0
176,i used this book for an introductory lesson on descriptive cataloguing in library archival and information science it worked very well for giving an overview of the problems in just this interdisciplinary approach a lot of examples are given and explained in an understandable way there are some reduncancies but this helps for the understanding,1
177,i ordered this book and read most of it in the hope that i would learn something about familiars in the interval between ordering and receiving my sixth sense made me begin to have doubts about ms little had she flown about the battlements of an old castle in the form of an owl had she entertained a hyrax or a feral cat as a house guest had she ever had a pet bat living behind a picture in the living room was she acquainted with the properties of henbane and twylight sleep and did she number hecate among her close friends the kindest thing i thought was to suggest that ms little knew as much about familiars as i know about conveyancing or futures trading and let it go at that,0
178,i read this book in less than one week normally i spend and average time of a month in finishing a book but this was one of the rare '' cases that the reading last until 2 am marcus travels to a wild land germania libera in order to send a gift of the emperor and ends with his life in hands of a german sorceress the full novel is filled with action and historical references it 's worth the money !,1
179,this story should have and could have been really good it presents a great concept but the story is just so poorly crafted it is very sexist the prose is stiff and the plot is dull i will concede that it was interesting at times it kept me reading but i really did n't get much out of it i can only praise heinlein for including the intelligent conversation '' which takes place after the press conference where there is a great explantion on why the english language is so difficult to learn the whole story is just very odd do read it though it 's a title to read if you wish to be considered well read '' despite its faults valentine michael smith will be a character in literature that will never be forgotten just as we will never forget atticus from to kill a mockingbird '',0
180,this book was easy enough to read it just was n't what i expected from quindlen i usually find her writing style and her way of thinking about things so captivating in this book i really did not find either of those traits to stand out the from current day to the past was somewhat confusing and sometimes i was in the middle of a paragraph before i realized this paragraph was a jump to the past whereas the previous paragraph was present time although i got used to that writing style i always found it annoying the storyline itself never sold me either a typical young '' boy finds a baby and decides to keep it and is the perfect '' father i just did not find such an occurrence likely and as a mother myself all the times he either left the newborn alone or took it with him while he labored on the land just made me squirm anyway the whole story seemed and disjointed to me and a disappointment especially since i have been a quindlen fan for many many years,0
181,i loved this story it was enriched with so many lessons emotions and detail that you felt like you were right there with lous and oz i would recommend this story to any one ! !,1
182,i devoured all of this writer 's books when i first discovered them and it had been quite some time since then when i bought this book i 'm a real sucker for a book with dogs so i dove right in only to become disappointed all too quickly i did n't remember all the rambling it is rampant ! at times it was almost like reading a text book for all the 'skimming ' that i did i ca n't say it was a waste of time but some more editing would be appreciated,0
183,i usually enjoy maron 's deborah knott books very much the characters are well drawn and give deep insight into southern life this one however is very flat and the characters are poorly drawn and one dimensional the first murder does n't seem to contribut anything to the storyline and is just there '' the second one involving dwight 's son who is a very poorly developed child character and his ex wife is not very interesting i devoutly hope this was the nadir of the series and it will improve after this probably not foresee several storylines involving conflicts glad i checked it out from the library and did n't purchase it the same and do n't waste your money,0
184,there is about as much additional science in social intelligence compared to emotional intelligence as you could write on a postcard mirror neurones and spindle cells nevertheless we can be thankful that daniel goleman chose to pay his tax bills this way firstly it serves to bring back the lessons of the earlier book to awareness which is goodness secondly it them more clearly in an format note that this already existed in emotional intelligence but was not so clearly called out the most positive aspect is the confirmation provided by fmri studies to previous empirical or intuitive knowledge on the importance of relationships to psychic ecology a would be against the reliance on seligman 's and csikszentmihalyi 's questionnaire based results questionnaire psychology is frustratingly limited in the gap between the suggestive nature of the results and the impossibilty of distinguishing between correlation and,1

186,i must admit i usually write only positive reviews as i buy books very carefully this is unfortunately a wrong buy i like the shabby chic style and since she 's the person to get inspiration from on this style i immediately bought this book without hesitation i must say i was n't inspired at all not even on one item and i am usually quite easily inspired by just reading a mag browsing through ebay or simply walking around the market the pics are big but on flowers i think i should 've got the first book instead,0
187,without question a book is needed to address the origin and history of late night television and steve allen 's pivitol role it sadly ben alba 's inventing late night steve allen and the original tonight show '' is not that book it is largely a poorly edited and pastiche of previously published memoirs by allen himself combined with some excellent interviews with allen 's tv contemporaries these interviews could form the basis of an excellent book by the likes of biographers scott berg sam goldwin or neal gabler walter winchle the opening chapter which addresses allen 's dysfuntional education and his early days in radio and tv sets the stage for the author 's failure to create a analytical portrait of allen and his work alba draws here almost exclusively and certainly uncritically from allen 's memiors while combining these words with one quote from a childhood friend and two early reviews taking allen and the reader 's one independent witness at face value allen had a rootless violent and unstable childhood given these negative conditions alba gives no hint of how why or even if allen really remained attached to his drunken and generally unstable mother and her equally troubled extended family the author gives us two brief stories from allen 's adulthood to demonstarte that the family ties endured actually all the stories show is that allen attended an uncle 's funeral and very briefly troted his mother out once on his sunday night show how did this dysfunctional world of allen 's youth effect his two marriages and five sons why after a childhood on the fringes of a perlious show business existance did allen choose this same career field for himself alba does n't even pose such questions about the boy 's effects on the man he just plows ahead in a haliographic haze throughout inventing '' alba maintains this pattern of unquestioning acceptance allen 's words no other witnesses are called no other points of view are examined steve tells a story alba accepts it and edits it into his text why not read allen straight,0
188,and i suspect this is what has happened to james lee burke the dave robicheaux series has been floundering sadly for several books now and that is tragic considering the promise of the early books which peaked in the hauntingly beautiful in the electric mist with confederate dead i grew up in southern louisiana and burke captures a culture that many people have no experience of but the series is becoming repetitive and stale culminating in this book which is just awful burke 's characters with the exception of the always funny and touching cletus purcell are wearing thin and becoming less and less sympathetic dave robicheaux becomes more priceless and preachy in each novel his tirades would make any prohibition era preacher proud burke has fallen into a trap of using the same imagery and phrasing again and again and it makes the reader wonder if he is n't cutting and pasting entire paragraphs repeatedly if i read one more time in a burke book that leadbelly strung his twelve stringed guitar in octaves i will be sick hey burke twelve stringed guitars have always been strung that way leadbelly did n't invent that tuning okay if i read the word phallus '' in a sex scene in one of burke 's books one more time i think i will just give up the phrases are getting old really old the preaching about political corruption and alcohol got old many books ago one thing to be thankful about in this abysmal wreckage of what was once a great series bootsie dave robicheaux 's wife is dead though that does n't keep her out of the story but at least the reader is spared another element that has been repeated to death the moment in every book with bootsie in it where she gets up in the night angry with dave and goes to sleep on the couch i 've had bets with other readers as to what page bootsie will do this inevitable stunt which then opens up the opportunity for another sex scene with the phallus '' when they kiss and make up in each burke novel where she is a character thankfully also alafair dave 's adopted daughter is far away at college and we are spared her teenaged brattiness which became tedious in the earlier books and yet another repetition of the story of how dave came to adopt her which is included in every book since the introduction of the alafair character it 's time for burke to let the series go it 's a travesty of its former self reading this book is like visiting a relative who has lost their mind to dementia you see a hollow nearly unrecognizable shell of a formerly vital and beloved person it 's painful,0
189,this is the first book by shaara i have read and if his other works are like this it is also the last on the cover persico is quoted as saying shaara makes literature read like history and history read like literature '' he goes on to claim that shaara brings the war to pulsating life '' i have even read a review that claimed this book was better than remarque 's all quiet on the western front i must have been reading a different book the first chapter the replacement is a great short story after reading it i had hight expectations for the book unfortunately it falls apart after that great beginning and it is a dull affair that completely lacks any sense of a coherent narrative from a literary point of view and the history reads like an grade textbook his narrative style is unable to give life to people that actually lived they are flatly presented and there is no sense of really caring about what happens to them after the dislocated short story of the first chapter the book delves into a story of the flying aces interspersed with summaries of historic events that do little more than ruin the flow of the story it frequently feels like the book is written for people who are unwilling to read a real history book shaara does n't even begin dealing with the trench warfare of the war until the 1918 's when the americans arrive focusing as i noted before primarily on the air war that occurred in the first years of the war i should point out that the air war would be interesting reading in a book of its own here however it seems more to reflect that the author did not deem the ground warfare fought by worthy of a story or was too lazy to research the events enough to write about the ground war from the british or french perspective and i have no particularly problem with him focusing on the american perspective on the war but then why bother with writing anything prior to our entry i suppose a smaller book does n't sell as well for those interested in historical fiction i would recommend bernard cornwall 's work and perhaps shaara can learn a bit from him,0

191,i 've read this book four times through the years since i first bought it the love between the two main characters though a forbidden love is so beautiful and magical it made me cry for meggy and father ralph not only is this an unforgettable love story it 's also a great education about sheep farming in australia magnificent description of a then harsh land the dialogue is believable the characters so very real i did n't simply read this book i experienced it when the characters laughed i laughed and when they cried my heart broke for them poor little meggy poor father ralph how bittersweet and memorable i really ca n't get over the quality of this book and the sensitivity of the author review by betty dravis author of a new epic love story 1106 grand boulevar,1
192,the author comes off as a whining unhappy camper about having to grow up in what he considers a 'stifling ' church environment further apalled by the church founder 's belief in that it the worlwide church of god was god 's true church through the ages right on up to the present 'end time ' feazell spends a good amount of time giving his negative opinions on herbert armstrong the church 's actual teachings and a general trashing and somewhat of a misreprentation of the general denomination as a whole labeling it a 'cult ' and further damning its pastor general as a heretic '' despite the church 's humanitarian works publishing colleges and international outreach for world peace over the past seven decades under the leadership of armstrong since armstrong 's death in 1986 feazell and his cohort joseph tkach seem to be having a field day jumping up and down on his remains and writing books on how great it feels to be loosed from having to keep the apostolic holy days sabbaths ten commandments which in his estimation are now the 'ten suggestions ' and general lifestyle of this day church of god denomination feazell apparently does not speak for all the church membership as over members left and formed various smaller independent church of god conferences throughout the united states and continuing the legacy and apostolic traditional christian system of worship restored by herbert armstrong in 1927. recommended reading autobiography of herbert armstrong '' mystery of the ages '' the incredible human potential '',0

195,many people remember the battle of midway as the turning point of the war in the pacific due to the sinking of four japanese aircraft carriers and rightly so but would the american success at midway been possible without the heroic actions of their torpedo squadrons probably not in this account of the battle author alvin kernan sheds much new light on these intrepid airmen who flying obsoloete aircraft and using defective torpedoes cleared the way for the sbd dauntlesses to deliver the crushing blows on the japanese carriers after sighting the enemy carriers the three american flattops began launching their torpedo bombers dive bombers and fighters in the hopes of making a coordinated attack on the japanese fleet however while en route to the target almost all of the squadrons became separated and the uss hornet 's contingent of fighters and dive bombers never even made it to the japanese fleet its aircraft either returned to the carrier or ditched in the sea meanwhile the planes from uss yorktown and uss enterprise were not able to coordinate their attacks thus the torpedo planes attacked without fighter protection these planes were thrown into a virtual meat grinder of anti aircraft fire and pursuit from japanese fighters out of a compliment of 51 planes 44 were shot down one man ensign george gay survived from torpedo squadron 8. not a single american torpedo hit the japanese fleet however this sacrifice was not in vain for a few minutes later the sbds found the japanese and in the span of a few minutes sent three japanese carriers to the bottom the fourth followed later in the day the author brings up some interesting points in the book for example he mentions the confusing flight plan of the hornet 's commander ring who for some reason chose to fly a course which would take him well north of the japanese fleet he then failed to write an after action report upon returning to the hornet the author also describes the inferiority of the american aircraft specifically there extremely limited range which in the end caused the american fighters to turn back also the fighters that did make it to the japanese fleet never flew down to help out the lumbering devastators in all intents and purposes the sbds happened to end up in the right place at precisely the right time if they had not the battle could have turned out much differently this is a fascinating book i 've read several books about the battle of midway but none have went into the depth of exploring the destruction of the torpedo planes as this one does the writer a former member of the enterprise 's air group describes the battle as only a true eyewitness could he raises some alarming quetions which i had never thought about before reading this book although the book itself is somewhat short it does a masterful job of covering the plight of the torpedo planes i highly recommend this fine book if you 've read anything previously about the battle of midway you must read this book it sheds some new light on the heroic sacrifice of the american torpedo squadrons and how their actions paved the way for the american victory,1
196,this is a badly written repetitive and account largely of the foolishness of portflio insurance '' that things which are just like '' something else may not be so in reality and that magic fixes in the market which after all fly in the face of the hypotheses which often are built into the view of the market being relied on i guess needs to be pointed out regularly since hope of quick uninformed and painless fixes seem to reoccur with each new wave of financial charlatans and the greed they feed on jacobs does point out such problems for a particular rather bizarre episode and suggests not too coherently that such scams '' are still prevalent however he does this in a horribly repetitive and way that is not really very clearly argued,0
197,line by line this book has some of the best writing i 've seen in a while this is an amazing thing since it 's still very and not at all overwritten the author just has an amazing eye for detail and a very crafty sense of humor the book surprised me constantly with its insights and these characters were so real to me by the end that i missed them for a week i read craig 's first book and it does n't stand up to this at all it 's exciting to see how much the writer has improved and i ca n't wait for the next one,1
198,kurt vonnegut 's book slaughterhouse five is a great piece of literary work in itself his unique style of black humor combined with his vivid imagination is second to none this book was exciting and unpredictable as i continued to read ! its main purpose involved the struggle of a man with his grip on reality is he or is he not crazy the imagery in this book was another great element and many regard this as one of the greatest books of the century this book is definitely worth reading and will not disappoint ! you ca n't go wrong with kurt vonnegut 's slaughterhouse five,1
199,the title is a misrepresentation this is not a handbook for driving a porsche quickly or professionally i bought this book because in 2 months i am going to drive my rear engined 993 on a circuit i have no circuit experience and can not get any coaching or any circuit experience in the country i live in since this is a rear engined car which i have little experience with i was particularly wanting some tips particular to rear engined cars there is nothing in the whole book which is particular to driving porsches or rear engined cars the only reason i will not throw this book out is because it has some interesting 1960 's and early 19970 's porsche racing pictures poor quality black and white though also to be fair there are some good racing stories he is undoubtedly a very impressive driver having been successful at the highest levels in rallying and sports prototype endurance racing a better title would be my porsche racing history '' if you want a book on fast driving i would highly recommend ross bentley 's speed secrets '' in place of this book,0
